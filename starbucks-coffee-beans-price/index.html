It leads to better livelihoods for farmers, and a better cup of coffee for all of us. In the process, we discover beans so special and rare that we can’t wait to bring them home and share. Because starbucks beans are pure arabica coffee beans, they tend to taste better as the increase in sugar enhances the coffee’s taste, cleaner mouthfeel, and a decrease in bitterness.</p>
