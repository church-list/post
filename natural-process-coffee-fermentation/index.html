<p><strong>Natural Process Coffee Fermentation</strong>. Cocoa fermentation is required for flavour development although it also aids separation of seed from fruit tissue. The concentration of sugars and flavors depends on the variety, ripeness of the fruit, and type of soil among other factors. Coffee processing removes the fruit from the seed; And so, just after the cherries are picked (or sometimes before, depending on the humidity), the fermentation process will start.</p>

<p>The soaking process starts to make the coffee cherry fruit ferment. Similar to a typical washed process but with the benefits of a controlled fermentation, carbonic maceration is common in wine making and has only recently been adapted for coffee fermentation. This natural process happens in the fruit’s sticky mucilage that surrounds the coffee seed, which eventually becomes the coffee bean that we roast, grind, and brew. Coffee fermentation, though it may have an impact on flavour development, is not required for flavour development and is conducted essentially to aid a similar separation of tissues. The fruit can be fully removed as in a washed process, the pulp can be removed but the mucilage left on as in a honey process, or the cherries can be dried whole as in a natural.

<p>Fermentation is a natural process that occurs when microorganisms like bacteria and yeast consume and metabolize sugars and acids. Fermentation starts with a symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast, or scoby. Skin, pulp, parchment, and silverskin slough off to reveal a beautiful bean. Fermentation is a metabolic process performed by organisms in search of fuel, and the other is a set of purely mechanical and technical steps used to prepare an. While all green coffee is processed, the method that is used varies and can have a significant effect on the flavor of roasted and brewed coffee.
