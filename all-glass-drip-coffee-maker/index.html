<p><strong>All Glass Drip Coffee Maker</strong>. Broadly speaking, normally a drip coffee maker is available even at $25 but of course, the price increases when we prefer to focus on more features and functionalities. We love the ninja specialty coffee maker because it offers the best of both worlds: An average brew station would last for 2 years. Itï¿½s beautifully simple and makes as good a cup of coffee as even the fanciest automatic coffee maker.</p>
