<p><strong>Whipped Coffee Foam Recipe</strong>. Either hand whisk or use an electric mixer until the mixture is fluffy and light. You can use a whisk, coffee frother, or electric mixer to whip up the thick coffee mixture. To make this magic coffee whip, start by mixing 1/3 cup of coffee crystals into a bowl, along with 1 cup of sugar. The recipes were titled both as “whipped coffee” and “beaten coffee.” obviously named for the aggressive workout one gets while whipping the mixture into a thick golden, caramelized foam.</p>
