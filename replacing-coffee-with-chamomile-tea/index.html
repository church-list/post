<p><strong>Replacing Coffee With Chamomile Tea</strong>. This means, you will use the restroom more often than usual after. And while you can choose to drink decaffeinated coffee, if you are looking to eliminate caffeine completely from your life, that won’t do the trick.

I’m slowly trying to replace my morning coffee/tea with some warm water with chamomile, lavender and lemon. Replacing coffee with tea is a healthy option that you should consider.

You can use tea bag tea, or even buy loose leaf tea.</p>
