<p>Best coffee creamer for intermittent fasting. After just 1 tsp of the sf peppermint mocha creamer from coffee mate my blood sugar rose to 132 after. I have a question here. This is when things change a little bit. I have a video on my youtube channel that discusses autophagy and intermittent fasting if you’d like to look into that topic further!

<p>This is much different than eating a full meal for breakfast and breaking the fast that way. Can i have cream in my coffee while intermittent fasting? You’ll cycle between periods of fasting and eating. I see you recommend heavy cream instead of half and half. Diet sodas containing xylitol or stevia are fine. Fasting for a couple of days permits you to go into survival mode without eating a lot of food and therefore invigorates your metabolism, enabling you to enjoy the numerous health advantages of intermittent fasting.</p>
