<p>What can you drink and eat while intermittent fasting. Coconut oil will not cause your insulin levels to rise. Mct oil will help you fast faster whether you regularly or occasionally practice intermittent fasting, taking mct oil can be very helpful. Mct oil is also easily converted ketones and enhances ketogenic environment [23] and has been shown to increase energy expenditure. Now, lets get into todays topic: It lets you splurge on a cup of satisfying, creamy goodness that relieves the “hangries” you get in with plain intermittent fasting.</p>
<h3 id="you-will-no-longer-feel-hungry">You will no longer feel hungry.</h3>
<p>It makes intermittent fasting easier in two ways: You can also emulsify with a stick blender, using the mct oil in your coffee also. Many people will sip on bone broth or keto coffee during fasting hours to stave off feelings of hunger and give their bodies enough energy to function at work, but that’s not all mct oil can do. It lets you splurge on a cup of satisfying, creamy goodness that relieves the “hangries” you get in with plain intermittent fasting. Fats (coconut oil, mct oil, butter) technically, you’re not fasting if you add any of these to your coffee because they all contain calories. Getting a smooth start on.</p>
