<p>Place the grounds in the base of your french press and cover with cold water. The cold press and french press methods of brewing coffee do not use filters. A french press is a type of pitcher with a special straining plunger that is used to make coffee or tea. While cold brew requires far more coffee beans, you end up with a product that’s less acidic and stronger in flavor than iced. A french press makes coffee taste more intense because there is no filter to trap oils from the coffee beans. Brewing coffee using the cold press method can take several hours but results in less acidic flavor than a typical brew.</p>
