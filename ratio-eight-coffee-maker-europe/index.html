<p><strong>Ratio Eight Coffee Maker Europe</strong>. Simulating a skilled barista pour over, the ratio meters the water flow to create a bubbly interaction called the bloom, resulting in even extraction. Ultimately, the temperature at which any individual coffee drinker will prefer their coffee is a personal preference, like so many other things that make coffee special. He weighed and ground the beans, then placed the grounds in the filter and “bloomed” them, adding just a few tablespoons of hot water to extract co2 and reduce some bitterness. The ratio is 14 inches tall, 13 1/2 inches wide and 9 inches deep.</p>
