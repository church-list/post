<p>Skip the trip to the bakery with easy homemade versions of your orders, like blueberry muffins, cinnamon coffee cake, and sticky sweet buns. Just be careful when placing the blueberry layer. This might be more appropriately called blueberry streusel coffee cake because there is a streusel topping that gives it the perfect crunch in every bite. Add to the creamed mixture alternately with sour cream, beating well after each addition. Serve with big cups of coffee and hot chocolate with plenty of marshmallows. That’s the only word that could describe this little coffee cake!</p>
