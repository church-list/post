<p><strong>How Is Organic Decaffeinated Coffee Made</strong>. So, only the coffee decaffeinated in this way can be called organic decaf coffee. This process uses no organic solvents, and instead only water is used to decaffeinate beans, a technique first developed in switzerland in 1933, and commercialised by coffex s.a. They steam the beans for 30 minutes, then rinse them with the solvent for 10 hours to ensure the caffeine is extracted. People may drink decaffeinated coffee for a variety of reasons.</p>
