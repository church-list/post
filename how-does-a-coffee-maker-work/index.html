<p><strong>How Does A Coffee Maker Work</strong>. One cannot simply start a day without a perfect cup of coffee. Inside this area is a turning mechanism that turns the coffee grinds and churns them into the liquid. When the moka pot is placed on the stove, the water heats up and generates steam. By attaching the lid and slowly pressing down on the handle, youï¿½re literally pressing out the water from the grounds.</p>

Then, fill the filter with 2 tablespoons of coffee per every 6 ounces of water youï¿½ll be brewing. Manufacturers of the drip coffee maker have honed the design of drip coffee makers over a period of more than 30 years and so this appliance is pretty direct when you open it up.
