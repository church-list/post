Then you need to adjust this based on taste, paying attention to the particular coffee beans and how finely they are ground. This ratio is applicable for all brewing methods: My husband is the one who drinks it. That is, is the coffee light brown, darker brown but not oily, or very dark and oily roast?</p>
