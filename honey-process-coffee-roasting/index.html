<p>It is the sticky texture and the golden amber color of the mucilage reminiscent of honey that led coffee producers to name this method the honey process.

As a matter of fact, costa rica was one of the first countries to modernize the washed process, building the earliest washing stations and wet mills in the middle of the 20 th century.
