But i don’t want coconut flavor invading my scrambled eggs, fresh popcorn or homemade chicken broth.and neither does the rest of my family. It can be done so with refined and unrefined methods.

<p>For coconut oil, choose virgin unrefined coconut oil. Yet the stigma is being removed as its health benefits are coming to light. I’ve been enjoying bulletproof coffee for about a year now, i drink it every morning. This process removes and concentrates the mcts (medium chain triglycerides) naturally found in the source material and provides more of the benefits specific to mcts (increased ketone production, metabolism, and mental clarity). Refined coconut is made when coconuts are baked prior to the oil being extracted. The oil is packed with healthy fats of which more than 50% are mcts.</p>

<p>It was only recently ostracized in the latter 20th century because of its saturated fat content. Virgin coconut oil* splash of nut milk (target carries so delicious dairy free in several varieties.) stevia to taste *if you do not like the taste of coconut oil, switch out the virgin coconut oil for a refined coconut oil. Unrefined coconut will smell like coconut, but it is the least processed form of coconut oil available. It no longer says expeller pressed unrefined virgin organic coconut oil. For everybody that has said that bulletproof coffee is disgusting, i completely understand now. September 12, 2016 at 6:12 pm.</p>
