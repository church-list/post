<p>Coffee snobbery aside, there’s no denying it’s convenient for rushed mornings, camping trips, or stashing in your drawer at work. If you are caught in the middle of making a favorite recipe and realize you are out of instant espresso powder, substitute with strong coffee or instant coffee granules. But, if you have a household full of coffee lovers, then buying in bulk or a tub of larger capacity could work out better in the long run. The powder can be immediately rehydrated with any liquid, which means that you can have a cup of hot coffee in seconds. But let’s say you don’t have espresso powder for your recipe. Regular instant coffee granules are weaker than the espresso type and so are not the best substitute.</p>

<p>I haven�t tried espresso powder but i have tried via and it is decent tasting. Coffee granules are usually for flavor.if you don�t have any and don�t care if it doesn�t taste like coffee, i would just leave it out. Instant espresso powder is brewed espresso that has been dehydrated into granules. You will need to dissolve instant coffee granules first if you plan to add it to something like cookie dough since it won’t mix right in the way espresso powder does. Instant coffee has less caffeine with just 60 to 80 mg of caffeine. I still sometimes include instant coffee powder or instant espresso powder in my recipes, though, and am often asked why this is.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that, unlike tea, when you make instant coffee, you aren’t actually brewing it so leaving a cup of instant before drinking won’t make it any stronger.</p>
