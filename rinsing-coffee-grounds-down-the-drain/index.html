<p><strong>Rinsing Coffee Grounds Down The Drain</strong>. Put some water on to boil either in your stovetop kettle or electric kettle. I use a garden hose with pistol spray. After you brew a pot of joe, donï¿½t toss the grounds down the sink. The blockage can then build up over time.</p>

<p>Coffee grounds tend to stick to the grease in your pipes and clump together. If youï¿½ve been putting your coffee grounds down your drain and you suspect that this may be whatï¿½s clogging it up, then you may want to work on cleaning them out. Then wait for the magic! The blockage can then build up over time. Dumping coffee grounds down the drain is a surefire way to clog your pipes. I used to use some chemicals but found them ineffective.</p>
<h3 id="coffee-grounds-might-appear-to-go-down-the-drain-easily-but-in-reality-they039re-going-to-pile-up-and-cause-a-sludgy-mess">Coffee grounds might appear to go down the drain easily, but in reality, theyï¿½re going to pile up and cause a sludgy mess.</h3>
<p>When mixed with water, coffee grounds clump together in your drains. Rinsing coffee grounds down the drain is bad for your plumbing. It is a common misconception that dumping coffee grounds down the garbage disposal will make your drain smell clean and fresh, but in reality, you should never pour coffee grounds down the sink. I know it can upset the chemical balance in a septic tank, but is there any evidence that it can damage anything else if you are on. Especially for people with septic tanks, coffee can clog the pipes and harm septic tanks if they are not properly discarded. Pouring coffee grounds down the sink is a bit like tipping sand down there.</p>
