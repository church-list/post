<p>A great cup of coffee is one of the simple pleasures in life. Therefore, to achieve the same quality and strength of brew in a mug that you would achieve in a cup, you need to increase your coffee scoop per cup from 1 to 1.3 or 1.5 scoops. For an even stronger coffee taste add 1 tablespoon of coffee for every 10 servings. Sure, some of that comes down to the beans. Our breakfast blend is mildly acidic, as none of our folgers coffees are specifically formulated to be low acid. Preparing coffee has never been easier!</p>
