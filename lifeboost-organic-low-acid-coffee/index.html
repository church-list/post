<p><strong>Lifeboost Organic Low Acid Coffee</strong>. (water is a 7 on the ph scale which is neutral) lifeboost coffee is certified organic, specialty bean, single origin, fair trade, shade and elevation grown a mile above sea level. A big strong yes for lifeboost I like that lifeboost say that they roast their coffee to order to prevent stale. They are committed to an organic growing and harvesting process, to fair and humane treatment of coffee farmers, and to getting the best flavored coffee possible.</p>
