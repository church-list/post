<p><strong>Chicory Root Coffee Near Me</strong>. Community coffee�s chicory blend is both tasty and strong (without the bitter aftertaste that puts even the boldest coffee drinker off). Chicory is the roasted and ground root of the cultivated plant species, chicorium intybus, subspecies sativum. Enter your zip code for a list of retail stores to see if they have your blend in stock. Interestingly, i found that even when i did tell people about it, their main question wasn�t what does it taste like?.</p>

<p>Inulin, a fiber derived from chicory root, is often added to food products to boost fiber content. The quality and cost is excellent. Typical preparations of roasted chicory root include decoctions, extractions, and infusions. It provides the body with inulin which may help with blood sugar, weight loss or appetite control.

<p>The quality and cost is excellent. Some coffee mixes include ground chicory to enhance the richness of the coffee. Personally, i�ve been drinking it for around a decade (i feel old!) and would periodically tell my friends about it (who, coincidentally, know everything about it now). Well, to answer that question, chicory coffee is not coffee because it is not coming from coffee plant but chicory is actually a herbal plant with scientific name cichorium intybus from dandelion family, so it is flower not berries like coffee. I imagine it works as a seasoning if you don�t want to drink it. Belonging to the asteraceae family, chicory is a larger relative of the dandelion.</p>
