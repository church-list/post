<p><strong>Behr Swiss Coffee Undertones</strong>. Here’s swiss coffee 12 by behr in context of its hue family neighborhood, 3 y, on the color strategist color wheel.the pink arrows point to where swiss coffee 12 fits in among the other colors according to its value 9.33 rounded to 9.25 and chroma of 0.74 rounded to 0.75. I have vinyl windows with white trim and it goes well with that. Palais white is less creamy than swiss coffee but is still a warm white with creamy undertones.
