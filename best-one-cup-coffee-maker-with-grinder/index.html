<p>A quality coffee grinder is one of the most important tools for making great joe at home. Cuisinart, oxo, breville and more. The breville grind control is pricier than the other 2 above but it does a good bit more and has the added benefit of the burr grinder, which is why i vote it to be the best single cup coffee maker grinder/brewer combo. It allows you to grind your beans and serve one cup of coffee at a time all in one machine. The grinder has eight different settings for users to adjust coarseness, and it can hold about 7 ounces of beans at once. This will save a lot of counter space, and these machine won’t hit your wallet too hard.</p>

<p>With all of its praiseworthy features, it is the best single cup coffee. If this makes you nervous, don’t worry! Most machines with this low of a price use cheaper blade grinders instead. The best single cup coffee maker kind of brings the best of both worlds together. If you get a single cup coffee maker with grinder combo, you might not have as many options for grind size as you would like. Pop in your favorite coffee pod, press a button or two, and you’re ready to go.</p>
