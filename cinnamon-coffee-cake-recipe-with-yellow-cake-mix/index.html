<p><strong>Cinnamon Coffee Cake Recipe With Yellow Cake Mix</strong>. In a large bowl, combine the dry cake mix, sour cream, eggs and oil; I actually thought i had shared the recipe for this cake a long time ago…turns out i didn’t. Remember the buttery glaze for the top! Reply claire a rea december 24, 2019 at 7:18 am.</p>

<p>It’s simple to make, crazy delicious loaded with cinnamon sugar and covered in sweet icing! Add the melted butter and stir until it clumps together like sand. You layer the two together and bake. Thank you for the recipe. Mix all the ingredients for the cake in a mixer for 7 minutes. So the coffee cake is based on a yellow cake mix (easy!) and creates a streusel out of graham cracker crumbs, walnuts, brown sugar, cinnamon, and melted butter.</p>

<p>Cinnamon crumb coffee cake recipe. Thank you for the recipe. Meanwhile, mix together brown sugar and cinnamon in a bowl. It’s rich enough to serve for dessert but because it has the word “coffee” in it you can 100% justify a slice of this for breakfast, too. It’s a recent craving that just hasn’t gone away! I’m hooked on the coffee cake with cinnamon sugar crumble topping.</p>
