<p>To make a tasty cup of freshly percolated coffee, there are a few simple basics that you need to observe. A coffee percolator is a pot used for brewing coffee, in most cases made from aluminum. This can be a campfire with a grate, a camp stove, or a grill. For a weaker brew, use a teaspoon per cup. In general, use one tablespoon of coarsely ground coffee per cup of water to make a strong brew. Add the coffee grounds directly to the percolator basket or put them into a percolator filter before putting the filter into the basket.</p>
