<p><strong>Best Tasting Coffee Pods</strong>. The best tasting coffee pods are the ones with great intensity so why settle for a weak cup of coffee when you can be jolted out of the doldrums with this intense blend? The coffee did have a bit of interesting brightness, but the finish was highly astringent, leaving our tasters� mouths dry and in need of a sip of water. There aren’t any fancy frills or artificial flavors here — just good coffee that tastes fresh. Not everyone has the time or desire to prepare coffee in the morning using an espresso machine or french press.</p>
