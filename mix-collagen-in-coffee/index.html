<p><strong>Mix Collagen In Coffee</strong>. My knees are awful, and the collagen in my coffee made a huge difference in the pain and tension i was experiencing daily. Our collagen coffee is great for anyone who wants a unique way to mix some extra protein into their diet. I add it along with my protein powder in my morning coffee. While collagen is probably most well known for its touted skin care benefits and as a major component of lip enhancers and injections, some celebrities, like kourtney kardashian, are suggesting that people drink it.products derived from collagen are not just in skin creams and dietary supplements but even in pillow covers and clothing.</p>

<p>Add a scoop of each to your next shake or smoothie or try our green breakfast smoothie with collagen peptides and organic whey protein recipe for inspiration.; Just a teaspoon of collagen powder is all it takes to give your morning cuppa an upgrade. Collagen is tasteless and odorless, so it won’t funk up the flavor, taste, or texture of any of your favorite foods. If you�re using an unflavored collagen powder, you don’t taste anything (but the declicious coffee). Actress jennifer aniston, bulletproof coffee founder and biohacking entrepreneur dave asprey and a slew of health bloggers are praising powdered collagen for its supposed health benefits. Just like a real cup of black coffee, it’s free from sugar and low in fat, and still comes in at a fraction of the cost of a high street cup of coffee, even with all that added protein.</p>
