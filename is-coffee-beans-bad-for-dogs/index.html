<p><strong>Is Coffee Beans Bad For Dogs</strong>. Dogs are experts when it comes to sniffing out tasty or smelly food lying around. Dogs and cats appear to be more sensitive to the effects of caffeine than people. Dogs and cats are far more sensitive to caffeine than humans and even a small amount could lead to death in the worst cases. Decaf coffee is made with beans that have had at least 97% of their caffeine removed.</p>

<p>Decaf coffee is safe for dogs. But, it�s best not to give him any cream as many dogs are lactose intolerant. As soon as you suspect the dog has consumed coffee grounds or coffee beans, you must take the dog to the vet. While there is not an antidote, medications and fluids can be. Coffee obviously cannot hydrate a hound (it’s a diuretic) and, more importantly, too much can actually be lethal. Dogs are experts when it comes to sniffing out tasty or smelly food lying around.</p>

<p>So, you’ll definitely want to keep that doggo away from your morning brew. But, it�s best not to give him any cream as many dogs are lactose intolerant. However, ingestion of unused coffee grounds or beans, tea bags, or supplements could cause serious toxicity in dogs or cats. This is not enough to make her sick. Although we mostly associate it with coffee, there are actually many other foods, drinks, and even medications that contain caffeine, because it stimulates the central nervous system and the cardiovascular system. The toxic dose of caffeine in a dog that is 19 pound would be at least 500 mg of caffeine.</p>
