When using coffee grounds on the scalp, they can act as an exfoliant on the scalp and may stimulate hair growth. Add an egg and a teaspoon of honey to coconut oil. Give your hair the necessary protein with this mask. The hair follicle is a complex organ, containing multiple parts that work together to produce hairs from the skin. The hair follicles soak up the nutrients better and it helps your hair to grow.</p>
