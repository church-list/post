<p><strong>Blueberry Coffee Cake With Cream Cheese</strong>. Fold into batter along with cream cheese. The baker in me by daphna rabinovitch is an exquisite hardcover cookbook and the quintessential baking book for any baker. Once it is baked, this coffee cake is super moist and delicious, and you are going to love the bursts of flavor with the cream cheese swirls and fresh blueberries. It is a cookbook review day and i have a gorgeous one to show you.</p>
