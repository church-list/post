Plus i don�t know how much would be in a cup of coffee (if it�s ground, it�s probably going to disperse all over the place, and even if you vacuum seal it into blocks, it�s still going to be iffy on the dosages). Bulletproof exec is his brand, not mine, not claiming it, please don’t sue me, etc.). As if bulletproof coffee didn’t already tout enough benefits, you can add other supplements to increase its effect. It’s gained increasing popularity in recent years as an alternative to the kava kava herb.</p>

<p>Bulletproof exec is his brand, not mine, not claiming it, please don’t sue me, etc.). Coffee beans that dave asprey makes, that are designed to have less toxins than run of the mill beans, butter, and mct oil. Whether you add it to a batch of black coffee or a cup of bulletproof coffee, it gives you an extra edge. Mct oil is an oily substance filled with 8 or so saturated fatty acids that the brain utilizes for quick energy. But let’s get to the bulletproof coffee thing. I drink bulletproof coffee in the morning for my breakfast (16oz of coffee mixed with mct oil and grass fed butter).</p>
