<h3 id="every-coffee-lover-knows-that-its-the-acid-in-coffee-that-gives-the-brew-its-distinct-bright-vibrant-and-delicious-flavors">Every coffee lover knows that it’s the acid in coffee that gives the brew its distinct bright, vibrant, and delicious flavors.</h3>
<p>So even though decaf has been shown to help reduce stomach acid issues, the bean actually starts with more acid when compared to regular coffee beans. In some cases, flavor and quality suffer in exchange for low acid content. The large number and relative volume of acid often results in an upset stomach, especially among individuals who suffer from acid. Simpatico low acid decaf coffees are mountain water processed (no chemicals!) and taste remarkably like our regular coffees, with a smooth finish but without 99% of the caffeine. We are very pleased to now offer a low acid coffee sampler pack for our customers who cannot tolerate high acid coffees. This coffee is our best selling coffee adored by our customers seeking low acid and great flavor.</p>
