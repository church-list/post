<p><strong>Does Black Coffee Raise Cholesterol</strong>. A study performed in 2007 at baylor college of medicine revealed that the diterpenes, cafestol and kahweol, found only in coffee beans, raise levels of ldl ‚Äúbad‚Äù cholesterol. But how does your daily caffeine fuel affect your cholesterol? For test #7, i drank filtered coffee for a week and saw similar results of 147 mg/dl. Cafestol, a compound found in coffee, elevates cholesterol by hijacking a receptor in an intestinal pathway.</p>

<p>It can raise your cholesterol level up to 68% if you‚Äôre taking two or more cups of unfiltered coffee every single day. The researchers from baylor college of medicine found that consuming five cups of unfiltered french press coffee a day, which amounts to 30 milligrams of cafestol, over a period of four weeks raised blood cholesterol by 6 percent to 8 percent 3. By the way, the cafestol remains at a higher percentage in unfiltered coffees. Researchers have known for years that unfiltered coffee contains higher levels of natural oils that can raise blood cholesterol. But, it apparently gets stuck in the paper filter. This suggests that cafestol and not caffeine causes the change in cholesterol 3.</p>
