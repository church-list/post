<p>Tea decaffeinated in these two methods is not bad for you, but it may not offer the same health benefits as tea that has not undergone a decaffeination process. Caffeine is extracted in the same way as with methylene chloride processing, but ethyl acetate is the solvent. After the caffeine is removed from the tea by soaking the tea in hot water for a period of time, the solution is passed through a carbon filter for caffeine removal. So far the best decaf coffee i have found is 8:00 coffee. The solvent is directly applied to the beans. You have just removed [50, 75, 80, 90] percent of the caffeine, but kept most of the antioxidants and flavor.</p>
