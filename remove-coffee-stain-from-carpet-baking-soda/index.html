Surfactants are compounds that are used in an array of cleaning products for their ability to lower the surface tension of water, which makes the molecules slipperier, so they are less likely to stick to themselves and more likely to interact. If the first soak in cleaning solution doesn’t get the entire stain, then you�ll need to step it up a notch. Does baking soda remove coffee stains from your carpet? To do this you need to pour out some vinegar on the stained surface and then sprinkle some baking soda on the vinegar soaked part.</p>
