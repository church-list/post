<p><strong>Vietnamese Coffee Filter Instructions</strong>. Pour two tablespoons of hot water into the filter and wait for 5 seconds to ‚Äúbloom‚Äù the coffee.

Pour hot water into the device until it is about 1/4 full.</p>

<p>Fill the vietnamese coffee filter with hot water. The backbone of the coffee shop is the phin, a traditional metal filter that nguyen describes as a cross between the pour over and french press and produces a deeply satisfying brew. These filters are great for people who don‚Äôt have room for a coffee machine or who like to make a single cup at a time. This intensely brewed concentrate is creamy, rich, smooth in texture, and has a bold flavor. Place the filter on top of the coffee cup. Vietnamese coffee is a combination of bold flavored french roast coffee (often times mixed with chicory root), dripped through a vietnamese coffee filter called a phin, and mixed with condensed milk.</p>

<p>Wait for about 20 to 30 seconds. Black coffee on the bottom and egg cream on top. Tap the filter slightly to evenly spread out the coffee grounds. The vietnamese are coffee magicians‚Ä¶ but to understand why, we need to talk about the beans. Start with just enough to cover the bottom, maybe 1/3 of an inch (~1 cm). Don‚Äôt add the ice yet.</p>
