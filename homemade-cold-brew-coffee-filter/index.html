<p><strong>Homemade Cold Brew Coffee Filter</strong>. I realize that this is pretty unusual. It is super simple to make and will save you $4 and a trip to the starbucks drive thru! The quantity of coffee grounds relative to that of water, or the ratio of the cold brew concentrate is what matters in this process. Why you should cold brew coffee at home:</p>

<p>Here’s how to make this cold brew into iced coffee just like starbucks does. It is really, really simple.mix coffee with water and brew. A little goes a long way, too: In the past, i’ve even made efforts to like it. Smooth since the coffee beans aren’t made with hot water, making it way less bitter. Cold coffee has long been associated with huge coffee chains, vats of whipped cream, sweet artificial syrups and other such miseries.</p>
<h3 id="feel-free-to-go-a-little-longer-for-a-stronger-brew">Feel free to go a little longer for a stronger brew.</h3>
<p>The dilution is the factor that is the easiest to control. Freshly ground coffee, water, mason jar and filter. Cold coffee has long been associated with huge coffee chains, vats of whipped cream, sweet artificial syrups and other such miseries. When you�re ready to serve, pour in one part coffee concentrate and 2 parts milk (or cold water). Fill the glass with ice. Use a spoon to help it along, if desired.</p>
