<p>Stumptown recommends using there hair bender beans within two to three weeks of roasting. Tried it in the french press, chemex, aeropress, and cold brewed. Stumptown’s hair bender is made to curl your locks, with a high caffeine content. The stumptown coffee french press just got better with this one because you can get two great options at once. The thing is, i almost always buy the same blend: The freshest i�ve ever gotten was about a 9 or 10 days past the roast date.</p>

<p>Fair trade organic whole bean coffee, sumatra. The hair bender, because frankly, it�s so damn good. We suggest that you avoid storing coffee in a fridge or freezer. The roasted on date was 2/2/18. Hair bender hair bender $ 15.00. The only thing better than coffee is a lot of coffee, and seattle’s best makes it easy to load up on java with its unbeatable prices.</p>
