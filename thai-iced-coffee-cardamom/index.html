<p><strong>Thai Iced Coffee Cardamom</strong>. Summer is almost here and it’s time for iced coffee to shine. The base is equal parts of sweetened condensed milk and half &amp; half cream. Now that the weather is warming up, iced coffee is my morning drink of choice. Add some vodka and kahlua for a thai white russian or some tequila and coffee flavored tequila for a mexican twist.</p>

<p>This thai iced coffee recipe is such a refreshing, flavorful, and easy iced coffee recipe. A cup of thai iced coffee has a very sweet taste and this is often due to the addition of sweet condensed milk. Into each glass, stir about 1 tablespoon of heavy cream. Thai iced coffee is refreshing and creamy with hints of warm cardamom and an almond extract. Dire circumstances like that mean cooling from the outside (as in dunking oneself often into a pool, lake or ocean) and the inside (ice cream, ice cubes, iced tea, iced coffee…). When the coffee is brewed, add the sugar and almond flavoring, mix well and then let the coffee cool to lukewarm.</p>
