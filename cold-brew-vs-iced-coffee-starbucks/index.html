<p><strong>Cold Brew Vs Iced Coffee Starbucks</strong>. This is the best way to make a cool and refreshing coffee drink like a cold brew latte or a coffee cocktail. However, if you like your cold coffee to taste like a cooled down version of hot coffee, a good iced coffee can really hit the spot. In this case, the cold brew is brewed with cold water instead of hot water. Thanks to the brewing process and thoughtfully chosen beans, cold brew boasts a natural sweetness with a hint of chocolaty flavor, versus iced coffee’s caramel and cola notes.</p>

Cold brew is made without heat, which creates lower acidity for a smoother, naturally sweet taste. Cold brew is not the only type of cold coffee drink. It’s not only more bitter and more acidic but certainly cheaper. The reality is not shocking since you can find so many local coffee shops along with other big brands like starbucks in almost every city in america.
