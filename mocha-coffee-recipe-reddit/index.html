<p>Click to share on reddit (opens in new window). I have really been enjoying cafe mocha &amp;#8230; I just don’t have time to wait at the coffee shop for my mocha latte. Brew a cup of coffee and measure out 1/2 cup of coffee and set aside. Based upon a starbucks caramel frappuccino, the natural sweetness is toned down through the addition of bitter dark chocolate curls and mocha sauce. This recipe is so easy and there is only one real trick to getting the flavor and texture of a delicious mocha frappe and that is to use coffee to make the ice cubes.</p>
