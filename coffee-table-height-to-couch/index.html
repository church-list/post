<p><strong>Coffee Table Height To Couch</strong>. The only issue is that this table sits at 18.5 in height, and my couch seats come in at around ~16.5/17. However, there can be caveats to this rule. Height of coffee table compared to couch. The height of the coffee table compared to the sofa should be same.</p>

<p>The height of your coffee table is also super important to consider. In general, the proper height of a coffee table is one that matches the height of the sofa cushions. If the cushions are extra think, the table can be 1 or 2 inches lower than that. To raise the height of a table temporarily, buy a set of bed risers, which are wood or plastic supports that go on the bottom of your table legs. The standard height of a coffee table typically ranges from 16 to 18 inches, a size that pairs well with a standard sofa. In this instance, a very low coffee table creates a crisp horizontal plane in the foreground that showcases the white sofa against the room’s wall of picture windows in the background.</p>

<p>Even if the coffee table height is right for your space, it may still seem unwieldy when placed too close or far from the sofa. If you have existing furniture, you�ll want to choose a coffee table that is the same height or one to two inches lower than the top of the seat cushions on. Determining factors when choosing the right coffee table for your needs include the height of nearby chairs, sofas and televisions, as well as what the table is used for on a daily basis. For example, if your couch is 6 feet long, you will want to purchase a coffee table that is 4 feet long. You may base the height of your coffee table on the sizes of other surrounding furniture or on your personal design preferences. This length leaves plenty of room for you to walk on either side of the table, and the size difference between the couch and the table will give your living room some stylish depth as well.</p>
