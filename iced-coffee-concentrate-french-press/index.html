<p>Serving cold brew coffee serving iced coffee. Pour it into a french press and gently push down the plunger. Pour coffee concentrate into another container. Of course, you don�t have to use the concentrate to serve a crowd. Place the lid on top, with the plunger in the up position so the grounds have freedom to move around and infuse the water. The filter is much finer than the mesh you would get in a french press, so your cold brew coffee concentrate won’t be as dirty.</p>
