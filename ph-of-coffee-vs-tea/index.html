<p><strong>Ph Of Coffee Vs Tea</strong>. Anything below a ph level of 7 is considered acidic, while anything above is alkaline. I start my day with 2 cups of russian style iced coffee, but i do so at home because i can follow it with a few glasses of water. Tea is not acidic enough to cause any harm. Therefore tea is slightly more acidic than decaffeinated coffee, but both are considered to be acidic drinks.</p>

<p>Most (93%, 354 of 379) beverages had a ph of less than 4.0, and 7% (25 of 379) had a ph of 4.0 or more. I start my day with 2 cups of russian style iced coffee, but i do so at home because i can follow it with a few glasses of water. For example, a ph of 4 is ten times more acidic than a ph of 5 and 100 times (10 x 10) more acidic than a ph of 6. Iced tea vs iced coffee? Lemon juice registers at about 2.0; Masala chai is a spiced tea that combines cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, ginger and black pepper with black tea in a delicious fusion.</p>

<p>Coffee�s ph averages about 5.0, tea�s acidity I�m not paying 7 dollars for coffee and water so i usually get tea. The value of this market has grown to an estimated 25 billion indian rupees in 2018. Tea has an acid level of 4.9 ph, and decaffeinated coffee has ph of around 5.0 to 5.1. Nonetheless, a cup of tea has almost half the caffeine of the same sized coffee mug. India has seen a growth in the consumption of coffee sold at coffee and tea chain stores including homegrown café coffee day, barista, starbucks and costa coffee.</p>
