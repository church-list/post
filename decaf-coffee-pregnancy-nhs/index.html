<p><strong>Decaf Coffee Pregnancy Nhs</strong>. I would advise to drink only decaf which has been decaffinated using the swiss water method. Limiting caffeine intake during pregnancy is important because consuming high levels has been linked to pregnancy complications, such as low birth weight, miscarriage and stillbirth. (nhs) advise limiting caffeine intake to under 200mg daily during pregnancy (around one to two cups of coffee a day),. Pregnancy is a vulnerable time.</p>

<p>It�s ok to drink decaf coffee and tea during pregnancy, but to not overdo it, says elisa zied, m.s., r.d., c.d.n., a dietitian in new york city and author of feed your family right. While there are still trace amounts of caffeine in decaf, you can safely consume a few cups a day without any issues. Everyone is different, so before running to your coffee pot after reading this article, consult with your doctor. I�ve been allowing myself up to 200 mg a day if needed. Drinking three to five cups of coffee a day could help people live longer, new research has found, the independent reports. Try decaffeinated tea and coffee, fruit juice or water.</p>

<p>Maybe coffee isn’t the right thing during your particular pregnancy. I’ve always thought it may be related to low birth weight. When ordering coffee in a café or restaurant, caffeine levels can vary from 80mg to 300mg per cup. To better understand caffeine’s effects on pregnancy (decaf included!) we’ve broken it down for you. It means that you don’t compromise on taste while removing caffeine that may have negative effects on your pregnancy. For many people, decaf coffee is still heavily associated with being pregnant.</p>
