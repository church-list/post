<p><strong>Coffee Table Size For Sofa</strong>. The height should be 5. To make your space feel balanced, choose a coffee table that feels proportionate to the size and scale of your sectional. The edge of your table should align with the end of the sofa. You want the coffee table to be proportional to sofa yet allow for enough walking space within the seating area.</p>

<p>The standard coffee table height is between 16 and 18, however, we recommend choosing a coffee table height that pairs well with your sofa. This distance gives enough leg room whilst still allowing the easy set down and pick up of drinks and the like from the table top. The average height of a coffee table is anywhere from 16 to 20 inches, and usually somewhere in between since the height of most seat cushions on sofas and loveseats is about 18 inches. An important thing to remember is to leave enough space around the coffee table for leg space. If you use a coffee table, allow an additional 12 to 18 inches between the coffee table and the sofa, plus the width of the coffee table. This rule of thumb allows for easy flow of traffic.</p>

<p>An oversized coffee table just feels right parked in front of a large, overstuffed sectional — and it’s big enough to accommodate all. What makes sectional sofas extra tricky is finding a coffee table that fits nicely into that little nook of space in front. For more ideas check out our gallery of types of sofa fabrics here. Leave at least a foot and a half between the table and the sofa. Traditionally, your coffee table should be 12 to 18 inches away from your sofa—any more or less than that will feel uncomfortably close or far. The edge of your table should align with the end of the sofa.</p>
