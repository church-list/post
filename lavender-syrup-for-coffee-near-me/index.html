<p>I personally love it and the nice floral taste and smell it gives the drinks i�ve added it to, but a bunch of people that have tried it with me said it tasted and smelled like soap. You can keep the bottle in the fridge, use it in the morning to flavor your coffee, and in the evening to flavor your cocktails. This lavender syrup tastes amazing in coffee but beware, if you have never had this you might not like it! I love supporting smaller businesses where i know i’ll be getting the best quality. Lavender latte’s are seriously my favorite thing in the entire world and i am fully addicted. Use your fancy new lavender syrup to impress your friends or just to add a little something extra to your morning cup of joe.</p>

<p>Aromatic and floral, lavender is embraced for its calming, soothing properties. My friends hate me because every coffee shop we go to, i have to ask if they have lavender. Use your fancy new lavender syrup to impress your friends or just to add a little something extra to your morning cup of joe. Monin even has obscure syrup flavoring for coffee such as lavender, granny smith apple, and even gingerbread. I personally love it and the nice floral taste and smell it gives the drinks i�ve added it to, but a bunch of people that have tried it with me said it tasted and smelled like soap. You are seriously my favorite person right now!</p>
