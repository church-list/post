<p><strong>Nutpods Oat Coffee Creamer</strong>. This keeps them versatile for everything from coffee to recipes. I was impressed at how creamy it was and made my coffee smooth and delightful. If your goal is weight loss, then your coffee creamer should not contain trans fats, artificial chemicals, excessive sugar, or fillers such as carrageenan. The nutpods oat coffee creamer has an oatmeal base and vanilla flavoring.</p>

<p>It was hard to believe this was sugar free and dairy free! For one person, 4 tbs of ground coffee, 2 tsp of raw cacao and 12oz of boiling water is enough for one standard size cup of coffee. In the morning, i usually brew a regular pot of coffee and then i add one tablespoon of nutpods coffee creamer (use code mylifewellloved for 15% off) and one tablespoon of oatly oat milk (or something similar). This way, i don’t break my fast, but this mama can still get her coffee in! Everything you love about nutpods, without the nuts. The next morning i could hardly wait to give nutpods oat creamer a try.</p>

<p>I was impressed at how creamy it was and made my coffee smooth and delightful. It was hard to believe this was sugar free and dairy free! Made with just oat milk, vegetable oils, and thickeners, this creamer keeps it simple, says duncan. In the morning, i usually brew a regular pot of coffee and then i add one tablespoon of nutpods coffee creamer (use code mylifewellloved for 15% off) and one tablespoon of oatly oat milk (or something similar). Sprouts, whole foods, and fresh thyme. We love this creamer because it’s made from oat milk and hemp cream, so it’s naturally more nutritious and has a luxurious texture that’s perfect in coffee or tea, and froths up great.</p>
