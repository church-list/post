<p>And yes, i weigh out my […] And yes, i weigh out my […] Simply put, the brew ratio is the relationship between the amount of dry coffee used (the dose) and the amount of coffee extracted (the yield). The ideal water temperature at the grouphead of the espresso machine should be between 195 °f / 91 °c to 203 °f / 95 °c, with a target temperature for most coffees of 200 °f / 93 °c.brew ratio, coffee roast level, coffee varietal, and processing all can have an effect on the optimal brew temperature. A scale allows for quick and easy measurement of both ground coffee and liquid espresso that ends up in the cup at the end of a shot. This is a case where experimenting is key, especially since brew times (and whether you brew at room temperature or in the fridge) can make a big difference.</p>
