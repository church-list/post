In a medium bowl, whisk the cream and sugar until the sugar has dissolved completely and the mixture is frothy. Using whole coffee beans gives a nice bold coffee flavor, and brewing the coffee beans in the milk helps to ensure a creamy smooth consistency to the ice cream. By steeping the beans in the cream mixture, you are able to extract pure coffee flavor without the extra water leaving you with a very rich, creamy bowl of coffee goodness. Repeat with the remaining chocolate sauce and ice creams, finishing with a layer of chocolate sauce. Bring to a boil over medium heat;</p>
