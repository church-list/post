<p>We are here another ember coffee mug. This mug is best for those who work all the time and do more jobs. This mug is so popular that it is sold in select starbucks. Extended battery life on your temperature control mug keeps your drink perfectly hot for 1.5 hours on a single charge—or all day on the included, newly redesigned charging coaster. I also tried a yeti cup for several weeks, but neither of these solutions would keep my coffee a perfect temperature. The ember heated mug intelligently senses when to turn on and off.</p>
