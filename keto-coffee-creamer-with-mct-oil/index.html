<p>Coffee with mct oil is the perfect way to begin your day. You can consume a full serving of keto creamer without having to worry about digestive issues. If you have tried mct oil in the past and your tummy reacted strongly to it, it’s time you switch to mct oil powder. If you want to give mct oil powder a shot, then use a special code aperfect15 and save 15% on your order. I used coconut milk for this recipe to keep it dairy free, but please look further down the page to find options that do include dairy.
