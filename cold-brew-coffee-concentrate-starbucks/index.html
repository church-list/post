<p>Just mix with water and ice for a taste that’s smooth, delicious and perfectly yours. Cold brew is best served unsweetened. Iced coffee is essentially hot coffee brewed at twice the strength and served over ice, as starbucks explains on their website. This creates a coffee concentrate you mix with cold water or milk. It is brewed in small batches and steeped for as long as 48 hours. However, cold brew concentrate must be diluted with one part coffee to one part water or milk, which again reduces caffeine levels.</p>
