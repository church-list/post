<p>Sanka, america�s first brand of decaffeinated coffee, has been a member of the maxwell house family of coffees for over 60 years. A friend of mine serves sanka decaf instant coffee in her restaurant and one day i tried it and it was a great cup of coffee. Stick to 2 to 3 cups to be on the safe side. Drinking 5 to 10 cups of decaf coffee could accumulate the amount of caffeine found in 1 to 2 cups of regular, caffeinated coffee. Since 1923, sanka has been custom roasted for the inviting aroma and smooth taste of coffee without the caffeine. As a lover of rich coffee that has been put through a french press, i can’t say i was hugely excited as the kettle boiled.</p>
