In honor of buck and his iconic creation, we�ve put together a list of products that either pay homage to his great design or just steal it wholesale. The ny coffee cup, also known as the �anthora cup� or the �greek cup� was designed by leslie buck in the 1960�s. The anthora seems to have been here forever, as if bestowed by the gods at the city’s creation. New york times, by john freeman hill;</p>
