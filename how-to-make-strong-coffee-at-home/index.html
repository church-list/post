<p>It’s kind of zen to set it up, the cleanup is easy, and the sputtering of coffee brewing will forever remind me of italy. Gather up some coffee, everclear, brown sugar, and vanilla. In order to make the coffee, you just need hot water, ground coffee beans, and filters. Leave room for cream and sugar if you take it that way. Pour the room temperature or chilled coffee into the glass. In this ratio, 1 tablespoon would be a mild cup of coffee, and 2 tablespoons would be a strong cup of coffee.</p>

Learning to make a strong cup of coffee needs more skill than just brewing extra coffee grounds. Generally increasing the coffee grind will add to a stronger, bitter, and burnt flavor per cup. It’s kind of zen to set it up, the cleanup is easy, and the sputtering of coffee brewing will forever remind me of italy.</p>
