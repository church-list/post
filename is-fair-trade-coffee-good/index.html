<p>Many advocates of fair trade, (including me), know that coffee being marketed and sold as fair trade is often different than the coffee being produced. They know good coffee — and how to make it. The idea of fair trade is really great! Direct trade coffee also indicates that a coffee roaster has purchased beans directly from the growers themselves. Among their great fair trade brews is the staple french roast, which blends a subtle smokiness with the richness of chocolate. By choosing fairtrade coffee you ensure farmers get a fair price for their beans and an additional premium to invest in schools, and reforestation and agricultural improvements, for example.</p>

<p>My local group of 80 members signed up to fairtrade at an important time. The similarities between fair trade and direct trade are that they both cut out the middleman, meaning that green coffee buyers work directly with coffee farmers. By choosing fairtrade coffee you ensure farmers get a fair price for their beans and an additional premium to invest in schools, and reforestation and agricultural improvements, for example. Start your day fresh with direct trade coffee and an ethically crafted mug. Sadly, these two coffee sourcing strategies aren’t always communicated very well.
