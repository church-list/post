<p>Turn off the laptop and disconnect it from its power source immediately. I spilled just a little bit of the coffee (it was actually a pretty watered down americano with a bit of soy milk) onto the keyboard of my mac about 4 hours ago. Turn off the laptop immediately. I spilled coffee on my laptop. Get to the the rubber mat underneath the keys and carefully clean it. Should have turned laptop upside down immediately but didn’t know.</p>

<p>My keyboard shut down unexpectedly once in that time, but other than that it�s been working fine. Spilled drops of water on alienware laptop keyboard. Pay special attention to the keyboard and the parts you removed. Liquid and electricity don’t mix. Your mac will work, but its life span has been reduced. The first thing i did was grab some tissues and soak up the excess coffee, power down my computer (it did not immediately short out), and let it sit upside down.</p>
