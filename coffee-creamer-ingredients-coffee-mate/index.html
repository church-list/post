<p><strong>Coffee Creamer Ingredients Coffee Mate</strong>. Corn syrup solids, hydrogenated vegetable oil, and sodium caseinate.sodium caseinate, a form of casein, is a milk derivative; This provides a rich and creamy flavor. Although the ingredients can vary by brand, most coffee creamers are made from a combination of water, sugar, and vegetable oil.

<p>I look forward to trying different flavors maybe different types of milk like almond or coconut. To one whole recipe of the powdered creamer (located towards the end of this post), add the additional following ingredients for the flavor of you choice (feel free to increase or decrease flavors to your own liking). This list of unsavory additives and ingredients just might give you the push you need. Luckily, no matter which flavor of coffee creamer you’re aiming for, the base stays the same and only requires two common ingredients. Corn syrup solids, hydrogenated vegetable oil, and sodium caseinate. My husband is one that has a little coffee with his creamer so we are always having to buy more.</p>
