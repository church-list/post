<p>Make very small circles very quickly, mostly using your wrist. The coffee is whipped along with sugar and water until is light and frothy and then mixed with chilled milk. To my surprise, the mixture started to thicken and change color after only a minute or two of whisking! Then, using a whisk or fork, stir the eggs quickly in a circular motion. Add the hot water, sugar, and instant coffee to a bowl. It’s easy, clean, and quick.</p>

<p>It turns out that instant coffee has a preservative in it called xanthan gum that helps stabilize the coffee when whipped—giving it that airy, frothy texture. It’s time to grab your barista apron and “whip up” some tasty new ways to enjoy dalgona coffee. To begin, add your instant coffee, sugar, and water to a mixing bowl and whisk using a hand whisk, electric hand mixer, or a stand mixer. That’s because the dalgona coffee gets fluffy and whipped through the mixture interacting with the air. To make whipped coffee, add 2 tablespoons of instant coffee, 2 tablespoons of sugar and 2 tablespoons of boiling water to a clean bowl. For example, use 4 tbs of hot water to 4 tbs of instant coffee granules.</p>
