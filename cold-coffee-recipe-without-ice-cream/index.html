<p><strong>Cold Coffee Recipe Without Ice Cream</strong>. Coffee ice cream is my favorite flavor, and i wanted to see if i could use the cold brew technique to get pure coffee flavor in the base. Really, it’s more of a confection than the standard iced coffee you may be used to drinking. You don’t need to spend lot of money on cafes just make them home. Past few days in london we are experiencing huge heat waves.</p>

<p>While preparing coffee beverages, usually coffee, milk and hot water is beaten with a spoon, till the concoction becomes light &amp; frothy. 1 gallon of whole milk {whole milk makes it creamier and thicker but you could also substitute a leaner variety} 1/2 gallon of vanilla ice cream. A perfect cold drink or milkshake for hot summer and an easy alternative to filter coffee or extra hot cappuccino. The addition of chocolate syrup in its preparation gives it a taste like no other. For preparing this yummy drink, all you need is milk, coffee, honey, fresh cream, vanilla ice cream and ice cubes. Really, it’s more of a confection than the standard iced coffee you may be used to drinking.</p>

<p>1/4 cup powdered instant coffee. This technique gives a really good creamy and thick cafe style. Thus it is also known as cold coffee with ice cream. I guess i’m lucky that way. Pour freshly brewed coffee into a large container (with a lid) of ice (work quickly so that the ice doesn’t all melt into your coffee). Ice cubes added while blending helps in giving you a frothy rich top over the cold coffee.</p>
