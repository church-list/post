<p><strong>Coffee Grinder Adjustment Mechanism</strong>. While the comandante’s adjustment mechanism is quite straightforward and easy to use, it lacks the ultra granular adjustment that some rivals offer. Manual coffee grinders usually have a screw adjustment mechanism that adjusts the burrs to produce varying texture from fine to coarse. The grinder could dismantle without any helps from the tool. The hopper of this grinder is a bit larger than others of its size.</p>
