<p>Maple bacon coffee cake march 22, 2013 2:00 am published by bacontodayadmin 3 comments. This recipe is made with jones dry aged bacon. Frost the gooey side of one cake, sprinkle with the finely diced bacon, top with other cake gooey side down on the bacon. Bacon and nuts in the crumbly topping blend with flavors of maple, nutmeg and cinnamon. The title says it all, i think. 4 tablespoons real maple syrup;</p>

<p>Let pan remain over cake 1 minute so pecan mixture can drizzle over cake. When cake has sufficiently absorbed all of the maple caramel sauce, top with the candied bacon bits. Whatever you choose, you don’t want to delay in making this for your family. Open the air fryer and brush the bacon with the maple syrup mixture. Add the syrup, being aware of the consistency. About half of the bacon pieces are mixed in with some streusel topping awesomeness.</p>
