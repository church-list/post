<p>To make vietnamese coffee using a traditional vietnamese coffee filter (phin) place the sweetened condensed milk at the bottom of a glass. It was a luxury to have a phin filter at home. This intensely brewed concentrate is creamy, rich, smooth in texture, and has a bold flavor. Place the spanner over the mouth of the glass, and then set the brewing chamber into the recessed spanner. However, most of the people could not afford the french press. Pour in a little boiling water to moisten the coffee.</p>
<h3 id="place-the-filter-over-the-serving-glass-and-then-add-1-tablespoon-of-hot-water">Place the filter over the serving glass and then add 1 tablespoon of hot water.</h3>
<p>Add vietnamese ground coffee to the phin filter chamber and place the filter press on top, press gently. Vietnamese coffee filter, also known as vietnamese coffee press, is the way to go for making a great cup of this coffee. The filter is reasonably priced and relatively sturdy. Then, add 2/3 cup boiling water over the top, stirring gently. The set can be found on amazon or vietnamese supermarkets in many countries. The one used for making espresso, south indian filter coffee, or the one used in french press is perfect for this iced coffee.</p>
