<p>Add the instant coffee with the rolled oats and chia seeds and mix well, before adding the maple syrup and the liquid (almond milk is what we prefer). If you don’t plan to heat up your oatmeal in the morning (which cooks off some of the liquid), decrease your milk to 1/2 cup and your coffee by a tablespoon or so. They are made from mostly oats but are mixed up with milk, yoghurt and a few other goodies and left in the fridge overnight. And the real reason i think they are so much better than i anticipated was because i used cold brew coffee for these coffee overnight oats, more of a concentrated coffee that is brewed overnight, or for about 12 hours to make a nice, less acidic, smooth brewed coffee. And since coffee tastes so fantastic with a bit of chocolate i thought it�d be a good idea to pair it with cocoa. Instant or quick oats are steamed longer and rolled out into even flatter flakes.</p>
