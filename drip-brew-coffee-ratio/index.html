<p><strong>Drip Brew Coffee Ratio</strong>. A ratio between 1:15 and 1:17 will get you from bold to standard. As with all brewing methods, we start by finding our ratio.

There is a higher ratio of coffee to water with cold brew coffee, almost two and a half times more, which means it is also stronger than a more conventional coffee drink with the normal water to coffee ratio.</p>
