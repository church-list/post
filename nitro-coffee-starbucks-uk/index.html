<p><strong>Nitro Coffee Starbucks Uk</strong>. Nitro coffee offers a thick and creamy texture that sets it apart from regular coffee. Nitro cold brew is made by taking starbucks’ original cold brew coffee (that’s coffee that’s been brewed by steeping beans in cold water for 20 hours or more) and infusing it with nitrogen. The launch of nitro cold brew in the uk follows a successful us launch of starbucks cold brew in 2015. Many independent shops have served it since 2012, but larger chains are now starting to take note.</p>
