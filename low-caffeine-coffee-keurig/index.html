<p>An alternative to decaf that’s becoming more and more widely available is a naturally low caffeine coffee called laurina. Tully�s ® coffee gets its distinctive aroma and rich, full flavor from our signature low and slow roasted process that imbues that taste of true craftsmanship into every sip. Overall, this is a decent coffee to drink if you don�t like the taste of coffee, but want the caffeine. I know that caffeine level is affected by multiple factors, including brew method, so i am happy to hear about bean recommendations as well as brew recommendations. This coffee is designed to use half caffeine proportions to give moms a guilt free experience when going through pregnancy. Because the flavor was on the weaker side, it barely had an aftertaste.</p>
