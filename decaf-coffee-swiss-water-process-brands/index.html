<p>Find out how we really achieve coffee that tastes so good you don�t miss the caffeine. Dean uses a natural water process (not the swiss water process, but something similar without the cost of using the swiss water decaf trademark) to decaffeinate the beans without stripping away the flavor. The direct process uses a chemical called methyl chloride. So which is the best decaf process for you? It’s similar to a french roast in flavor. Flavor runs throughout every cup, all while avoiding the infamous “bitter finish.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-are-feeling-trendy-you-can-try-the-supercritical-co2-process">If you are feeling trendy you can try the supercritical co2 process.</h3>
<p>In a nutshell, the swiss water process relies on caffeine solubility (dissolvability) and osmosis to remove caffeine from green coffee beans. This method does not remove other organic compounds from the coffee, so it affects the taste of the coffee the least. The swiss water decaffeination process removes more than 97% of caffeine, but the coffee retains its strong flavor without the bitterness. It’s similar to a french roast in flavor. Unfortunately, some may not have the ability to consume caffeine, so we made it our goal to find the absolute top tier. Your cup of coffee will be slightly sweet with hints of chocolate and caramel and a fruity aroma.</p>
