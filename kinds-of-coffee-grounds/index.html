<p>Coffee grounds have a reputation for solving all kinds of garden problems. The fact that it comes with so many options and flexibility in brewing techniques makes it so popular among people. There is a deeper layer of coffee grounds in a cone shaped filter than there is in a flat shaped filter. The force of the water produces a highly concentrated coffee shot.
