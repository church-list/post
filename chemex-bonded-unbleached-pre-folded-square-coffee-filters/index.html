<p>Made from durable paper, chemex filters are heavier than competitive brands width length weight 1. This order was shipped carefully and arrived quickly. I had to use the unbleached filters however, everyone served was disappointed and i feel like i wasted some pretty nice coffee using these (honestly, they�re that bad even when heavily rinsed). Enjoy bold and rich flavors of your favorite coffee grounds A lot of frustration for something so simple. 290mm x 290mm square 100 filters per pack.</p>

<p>Thicker specialty fibre filter design keeps bitter elements, oils, and grounds in their place (and out of your cup). A lot of frustration for something so simple. 290mm x 290mm square 100 filters per pack. I had to use the unbleached filters however, everyone served was disappointed and i feel like i wasted some pretty nice coffee using these (honestly, they�re that bad even when heavily rinsed). I prefer the unbleached paper. Get best deals and exclusive offers.</p>
