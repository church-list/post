<p><strong>Sweet Cream Foam For Coffee</strong>. King arthur’s meringue powder (wilton brand doesn’t taste good in my opinion.) 3 tbsp. The bitterness of the coffee paired with the slightly sweet and salty creamy layer on top is something you have to taste to believe. Add the salted cream cold foam over the top of your cold brew to give it that nice layered look and you have your own homemade salted cream cold foam cold brew! Cold brew coffee is also deceptively easy.</p>
