<p>Instant coffee is almost always poor quality, while ground coffee can range from poor to excellent. From cookies to chilis to barbecue, coffee is a bonafide staple outside of its drinking applications. Instant coffee is available as granules or in powder form. Instant coffee is made from ground coffee that is brewed and extracted into liquid form, then dehydrated and changed into a solid form in order to prolong its shelf life, ruin its flavor and body, and flatten out its complexity. In terms of taste and flavor, ground coffee provides much better aroma and depth to your daily coffee. Starbucks via is undoubtedly one of the top sources of instant coffee out there, with many reviews comparing it favorably to other methods of making coffee.</p>

<p>Instant coffee is in fact made from real coffee. In contrast, it’s suggested that instant espresso be used solely for baking. From cookies to chilis to barbecue, coffee is a bonafide staple outside of its drinking applications. What makes coffee instant is when all the water is removed from the brewed product, leaving behind dehydrated crystals of coffee. Same goes for baked goods: Whole beans are roasted, ground and brewed before they start their journey to becoming instant.</p>
