<p>Is it actually bad to flush coffee grounds down the kitchen sink. A few things can happen when coffee drains are put down the drain or are used to “clean” the disposer. This means that, while you could put coffee grounds down the garbage disposal, it’s recommended that you avoid doing so at all costs. Food scraps, rags, paper towels. You probably make a pot of coffee before you leave for work, and if it�s your day to do it at the office, you�re probably making another pot there before noon. Some plumbers say coffee grounds down the drain are ok if you run enough water to flush them completely out of the plumbing system.</p>
<h3 id="coffee-grounds-can-damage-your-pipes-and-septic-system">Coffee grounds can damage your pipes and septic system.</h3>
<p>It takes a lot of water in most houses to rinse them that far. Both coffee grounds and eggshells are sedimentary in nature, if too much is placed in at one time, or if the plumbing is restricted, it can create a clog or a ‘slow drain’ situation. Some even praised their effects on the drain, claiming coffee grounds helped to scrub the pipes and keep it smelling fresh, as buster explains. Don’t fall prey to the myth! If food can go down the garbage disposal, why isn’t the same true for coffee grounds? Slowly pour the diluted mixture down the drain.</p>
