<p><strong>Flat White Coffee Recipe Starbucks</strong>. Ristretto espresso shots use the same amount of coffee but less water, and that results in a smaller, more concentrated serving with a sweeter, richer flavor. Adjust the sweetness to taste with agave nectar (you’ll need a lot if you want it as sweet as starbucks) and add coconut milk to give it that pale blushing color and creamy texture. Mix 1 to 2 teaspoons of the tangerine sugar (i use 1 1/2 teaspoons) with the cinnamon, ginger, and cloves. For inspiration, read our article about the history of latte art or watch the video.</p>
