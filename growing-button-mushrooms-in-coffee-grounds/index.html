<p><strong>Growing Button Mushrooms In Coffee Grounds</strong>. Since mushrooms are fungi, they can grow almost anywhere and thrive. Mushrooms should start to appear in about 7 days or so. Coffee grounds are a fantastic growing medium for mushrooms (oyster mushrooms in particular) as they are already sterilized thanks to the coffee brewing process and are full of nutrients. Plus, spent coffee grounds are a huge waste resource, and are packed full of nutrients which your oyster mushrooms love to grow on.</p>

<p>Mushrooms grow rapidly in cool, dark, and humid environments. Wait until your coffee grounds are cool enough that they are no longer steaming, but not quite cold and put one pot worth of grounds, including the filter, in a bag or jar. King oyster mushrooms can grow in the same substrate as oyster mushrooms. The next three sections will cover step by step how to grow button mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms, and oyster mushrooms. Mushrooms grow best at temperatures between 55 and 65 degrees fahrenheit. See more ideas about growing mushrooms, stuffed mushrooms, garden mushrooms.</p>

<p>Use your own compost and purchase manure, like horse or cow manure, at the store, or buy both if you don�t have a compost pile. Mushrooms concentrate whatever they grow in. Used coffee grounds, mushroom spawn with sawdust (oyster or shiitake), a bucket/container of 2 to 5 gallon in size, spray bottle and cellophane. This is another easy and ingenious method and one you will love to experiment with. Start them in coffee grounds then finish in pasteurized straw.
