<p><strong>Coffee Protein Smoothie King</strong>. Just like any smoothie offered at smoothie king, the keto champ comes in all three sizes: On a rainy day, there’s nothing i like more than sitting by the window and writing with a delicious treat nearby to sip or snack on. I opt for more natural sweeteners like real maple syrup or coconut sugar in my coffee smoothie, since they also have trace amounts of beneficial nutrients. Smoothie king is now serving the metabolism boost banana passion fruit smoothie, made with bananas, pear passion fruit juice, papaya juice and a protein blend including gladiator protein, fiber.</p>
