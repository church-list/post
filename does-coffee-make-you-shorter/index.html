<p><strong>Does Coffee Make You Shorter</strong>. Extreme amounts of caffeine could cause you to stop growing, but that would take alot more than even a pot of coffee a day. Therefore, you can enjoy your morning coffee or tea without worrying about any effect on stature. However, this has been proved by science to be false and there is no evidence supporting this hypothesis. Does coffee actually make you shorter?</p>

<p>But coffee does contain caffeine, which stimulates the central nervous system. You may wonder whether this means that you’ll live longer if you drink a lot of coffee. But if you’re drinking more — especially if you’re also getting caffeine from other sources, like soda or energy drinks — you may want to cut back. Extreme amounts of caffeine could cause you to stop growing, but that would take alot more than even a pot of coffee a day. Caffeine cannot stunt growth and there is no scientifically background that supports this myth. It’s quite possible that tea and coffee drinkers lead healthier lifestyles on account of the reduced risk of diseases.</p>

<p>But if you’re drinking more — especially if you’re also getting caffeine from other sources, like soda or energy drinks — you may want to cut back. Does coffee make you shorter? If it stunted growth, they would be shorter than us. But wait a while, it does indeed make you short later on (years probably) when your bones are already affected, since coffee is believed to affect the loss of calcium in your body. No, coffee does not make people shorter its just a wise tail. Caffeine cannot stunt growth and there is no scientifically background that supports this myth.</p>
