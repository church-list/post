<p>This is really a brilliant idea for gardening. And you say you don’t have any use for them anymore? Also, make sure that both the soil and the pot your coffee plant is growing in has good drainage. The rustic texture of an old tire can be covered with few strokes of metallic paint. Again, you can paint it as you want, even as your coffee mug. Use these diy teacup tire planters to add plants to your garden collection!</p>
