<p>Roasting coffee beans produces coffee that’s lower in acidity and cold brewing also imparts this effect because fewer compounds are imparted into the coffee when it is cold brewed. This will have less acid than a fine grind. Certain varieties of coffee are also naturally less acidic, which may be a result of being grown at a lower elevation or using particular drying methods. However, it is possible to make hot brew coffee itself less acidic, though it may not be as low acid as cold brew coffee. There’s very little literature and research behind cold brew coffee as compared to hot brewed coffee. Two heaping tablespoons of ground coffee for each 6 oz of fresh water.</p>
