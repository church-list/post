<p>Ground coffee, brown or white sugar, coarse salt (for the body scrub) and coconut oil. See my disclosure policy for more info. Finely ground coffee beans are actually an amazing additive to homemade scrubs for multiple reasons. The coffee grounds can be used, but they must be dry. Pour 1/2 cup (56 g) of coffee grounds into a bowl, then add 1/2 cup (115 g) of coconut palm sugar. This post may contain affiliate links.</p>

<p>6 oz of hot spring/purified water; Homemade coffee scrub makes a perfect body scrub, especially for the face and other delicate areas. In a mixing bowl, combine 1/4 cup of organic brown sugar (such as simply balancedï¿½s brown sugar ), 1/2 cup of fresh coffee grinds, 1/4 cup of sweet almond oil (such as artnaturals premium sweet almond oil ), and vanilla essential oil. For my homemade body scrub, i use fresh ground coffee and organic cane sugar. Coffee beans are actually pretty amazing on the external body. If you canï¿½t find coconut palm sugar, you can use other types of sugar, such as organic cane sugar or brown sugar.</p>
