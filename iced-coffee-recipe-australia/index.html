<p><strong>Iced Coffee Recipe Australia</strong>. After trying that aussie iced coffee, i had to ask my australian friend if this was a thing.she said that she’d seen iced coffee with ice cream before, but it wasn’t a thing … hmm. Not only did i like it, i decided i could learn how to make an iced coffee recipe of my own. Always sweet, always milky, always with a dollop of cream and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. A refreshing iced coffee recipe with an exotic twist.</p>

<p>And the answer to my search for a classic iced coffee recipe. This was great, says tammy. By brewing the hot coffee straight onto ice, it cools the brew down and dilutes it at the same time, creating a delicious, cold filter coffee. Place ice cubes, ice cream, and coconut milk into a blender. Sweetened condensed milk is cow’s milk with all of the water removed and extra sugar added in. Pour the coffee into a heat resistant container.</p>
