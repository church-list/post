<p><strong>Lactose Intolerant Coffee Creamer</strong>. There are several products that you can add to your coffee for flavor that do not contain lactose. However, it should not be expected to contain very much lactose at all, and if you are lactose intolerant, there most likely is not enough lactose in it to affect you. I only bring it up since it�s a staple in fake dairy like soy creamer and i�m told it�s a fairly common and under diagnosed allergen. And interestingly when it comes to coffee, although these coffee lovers were initially very fond of coffee, some things make them have to reduce the amount of coffee.</p>
