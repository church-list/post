<p>Brew 2 cups of strong coffee (about 2 tablespoons coffee grounds per cup of water). While it’s brewing, mix 1 cup of cold milk and a few drops of french vanilla syrup in a tall glass. The usual ratio of coffee to water for the style of coffee most prevalent in europe, america, and other westernized nations is between one and two tablespoons of ground coffee per six ounces of water. You can always adjust up or down depending on your taste preferences, but 2 tablespoons will generally produce the best, richest coffee. Most coffee experts use 1 cup of coffee equals 6 ounces of water. There are a few, predetermined ways of getting the right amount of ground coffee per cup and as a general guideline, the golden ratio is the baseline to which all perfect brews are held against.</p>

<p>If your drip coffee maker is 1 cup of coffee equals 5 ounces of water, you need less grounds. This is equivalent to one gram of coffee per 16 millimeters of water, if you want to be more precise. A rough guideline for a deep, balanced brew is to use two tablespoons of ground coffee for every six ounces of water (3/4 cup). Strength settings of 1 to 7 are available. There is an easy to remember the rule for measuring out the perfect coffee called the golden ratio. The calculator below does this math for you.</p>
