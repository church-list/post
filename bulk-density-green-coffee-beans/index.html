<p>Consider that the bulk density of small low density beans could be the same as that of larger, more dense beans. For green coffee, higher density tells us there is a greater concentration of cells and a more compact cell structure than its lower density counterparts. Bulk density was evaluated as the ratio between the weight and the volume of the 100 beans sample in a 50 ml graduated recipient (dutra, oliveira, franca, ferraz, &amp; afonso, 2001). Sustainable, social and environmental impact. Sinar technology are proud to announce an exciting update to our sinar beanpro 6070 coffee analyser.
