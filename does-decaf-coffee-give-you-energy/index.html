<p><strong>Does Decaf Coffee Give You Energy</strong>. A study suggests caffeine is not responsible for coffee�s stimulant effects If caffeine causes an uncomfortable pounding in your chest, shaking hands and jittery nerves, you may want to consider decaf coffee. As you drink coffee, the caffeine is absorbed through your bloodstream almost immediately giving you a jolt which can last for a few hours. At the same time, decaf coffee is actively beneficial to your health in many of the same ways that regular coffee is despite not including caffeine.</p>
