<p><strong>White Chocolate Coffee Cake</strong>. The white chocolate icing seems to give the cake a nice caramel flavour. There’s just a hint of cinnamon flavor and there’s a crumb topping that not only gets sprinkled on top, but there’s a layer of it in the middle to evenly distribute all those macadamia nuts and white chocolate chips. This soft coffee cake with cranberries is a twist on the starbucks cranberry bliss bar and is super popular with our family. Try our white chocolate cake!</p>

<p>A square for breakfast in bed sounds like the best idea! The cake has a nice, dense crumb, almost like a pound. Combine the walnuts, brown sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle over the cake. The texture is transformed from “cake” to tender cake which is simply dreamy. Stonyfield organic yogurt is the ingredient to thank for that. The cake is a simple and super moist chocolate sour cream cake.</p>
