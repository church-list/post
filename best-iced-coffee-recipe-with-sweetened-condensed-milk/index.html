<p>*see tip at bottom of page for iced coffees. Sweetened condensed milk coffee is a simple way to enjoy your morning coffee. In a blender add sweetened condensed milk and hot coffee. Use a coffee to water ratio of 1:8 in a french press. Spoon 2 tablespoons of sweetened condensed milk into each of 4 coffee cups. Stir to get all of the coffee grounds wet then let it sit 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Delicious on hot days, says kate. It doesn’t get much simpler than that, does it? Because everything in it is so intense, it benefits from being poured over ice and diluted just a bit to help those flavors and textures meld as they chill. Use a coffee to water ratio of 1:8 in a french press. Blend until smooth and creamy. Sweetened condensed milk is added to the bottom of the glass and that’s what gives the coffee it’s strong sweetness.</p>
