<p><strong>Does Coffee Cause High Blood Pressure</strong>. Caffeine may cause the adrenal glands to release excess cortisol and adrenaline —substances that typically cause a further rise in blood pressure. Decaffeinated coffee, on the other hand, usually contains little if any caffeine, making it much less likely to raise your blood pressure. People who drink alcohol excessively (over two drinks per day) have a one and a half to two times increase in the frequency of high blood pressure (hypertension).the association between alcohol and high blood pressure is particularly noticeable when the alcohol intake exceeds 5 drinks per day. Caffeine can cause a short, but dramatic increase in your blood pressure, even if you don�t have high blood pressure.</p>
