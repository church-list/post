<p>Pour the frothy coffee on top of the milk. It’s basically a cold latte drink topped with a smooth velvety sweet coffee foam, somewhat like a reverse cappuccino. What is happening in the dalgona is we’re whisking the ingredients to form a foam. The combination of cold milk and the bittersweet coffee is absolutely delicious.

The drink is made by whipping up instant coffee, sugar, and hot water until it creates a creamy foam topping to add to hot or cold milk. Of course, with all that sugar and milk, regular dalgona coffee is not very keto friendly.</p>
