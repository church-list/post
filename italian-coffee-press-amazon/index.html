<p><strong>Italian Coffee Press Amazon</strong>.

The molinari platino roasted coffee beansis characterised by a persistent aroma, perfect for customers who want to rediscover the taste of atraditional coffee. Then, fill the coffee press halfway with the hot water. Press the coffee slightly (do not press too hard, otherwise the waterdamp will not pass through the coffee ground).</p>
