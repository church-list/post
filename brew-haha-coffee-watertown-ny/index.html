<p>I am not a coffee drinker at all but was convinced to try a specialty latte. The brew haha trailer is outside of the junque drawer at 233 s. 468 coffeen st, watertown, ny. They used to make delicious snicker drinks and italian sodas. But the guys are kinda rude. See more of the brew haha on facebook.</p>

<p>What a great start to our morning and way to make it through the day!üëèüèªüëçüèª rudd‚Äôs got some awesome coffee from brew haha for our #smallbusinesssaturday! I am not a coffee drinker at all but was convinced to try a specialty latte. And black river parkway for the freshest coffee made, using the highest quality coffee from the black rifle coffee company. Great bagels and lattes :) nice way to start the morning.
