<p>It brings a rich, natural flavor to your morning cup of joe and its creaminess is “simply beyond compare,” according to the brand’s website. This is a 100% vegan milk boosted with pea protein and sunflower oil. Califia farms unsweetened better half. The vanilla is perfect expect if i drink 3 cups of coffee in a day for 7 days, these little 2 bottles won�t cut it. This was the creamer i wanted when i accidentally thought the fudge one was it.lol. Their soy creamer is soooo creamy and has few enough added sugars to be listed as 0g on the nutrition label (there is organic evaporated cane juice in the ingredients though).</p>

<p>It’s not sugary sweet like the silk coffee creamer at all. This is a 100% vegan milk boosted with pea protein and sunflower oil. It also does not contain any nut ingredient, perfect for those that are allergic to nuts. However, these are facing stiff competition from emerging flavors such as oats, flax seeds. Plant based milk, like soymilk, oat milk, or even hemp milk, are thicker milk alternatives that usually have a more distinct flavor. If you love all things coffee, it can be fun to try new beans, an occasional latte or espresso, and yes, even new creamers.</p>
