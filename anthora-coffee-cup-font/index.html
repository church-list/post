<p>The cup was originally designed by leslie buck of the sherri cup co. Iconic television series, such as law &amp; order and friends, have featured cameos of buck’s creation, while copycat designs continue to flood the market.at the height of its popularity in 1994, the anthora reached 500 million in sales, making it the most popular. The amphora jug, along with the meander pattern and lettering evocative of the ancient greek script, is depicted on the anthora which also sports the colors of the greek flag. The blue and white colors pay homage to the greek flag, while the font is reminiscent of athenian lettering. Introduced in the 1960s, the anthora was long made by the hundreds of millions annually, nearly every cup destined for the new york area. Ahhh for the good old days.</p>
