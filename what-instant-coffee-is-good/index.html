If you’re in a hurry to get to work, but coffee is life, instant coffee will save the day by giving you the caffeine boost you crave. In fact, many people choose instant over the real thing simply to save money and because they don�t mind the difference in taste.

However, instant coffee itself can vary in price, from very cheap little packets to more expensive products from boutique brands.
