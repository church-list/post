<p><strong>Costco Coffee K Cups Decaf</strong>. They are designed specifically for use with keurig coffee makers, are conveniently packed and fulfilled in 120 count cases, and are crafted with 100% premium arabica beans. The winner will probably surprise you. Since i often brew my cups at the 6 oz or 8 oz size, the lighter brew is sometimes �fine� and being it was in my budget for the day, i tried it. I’m actually drinking costco coffee as i write this :).</p>
