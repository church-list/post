<p>The cold brew old fashioned is based on the classic cocktail made famous by don draper, but uses cold brew coffee in place of bourbon or whiskey. One of them was learning about iced coffee and cold brew. Although, if you are like me, i use the cold brew and the bourbon! Gradually add 7 cups cold water. Don’t drink cold brew concentrate straight—it’s highly caffeinated! This depends on a lot of factors, including the beans used, steeping time, and dilution.</p>

<p>Your average iced coffee is made by cooling down hot drip coffee, but cold brew is made by steeping ground coffee in cold water for at least 12 hours. Pour out the iced coffee concentrate. Stir the coffee and water together in a mason jar, liquid measuring cup, or other container and then cover with a lid or plastic wrap. Let’s be honest, iced coffee is not hot coffee poured over ice. Cold coffee has long been associated with huge coffee chains, vats of whipped cream, sweet artificial syrups and other such miseries. It�s rich and smooth—and it�ll change the way you drink iced coffee.</p>
