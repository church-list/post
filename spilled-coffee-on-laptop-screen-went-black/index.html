<p><strong>Spilled Coffee On Laptop Screen Went Black</strong>. I don�t think there�s a mainstream laptop in the world with a waterproof keyboard. This happened about 5 hours ago. After that, turn your laptop upside down and flatten it out completely so that the keyboard and the screen are on the same level. It�s typically on the left.</p>

<p>My wife just spilled hot coffee on our dell studio 1555 laptop. I was wondering what advice you have on helping the laptop detect the charger? Obviously, when i bought a new macbook, i decided to research what to do in case of a water spill. I tried to dry it as quickly as possible. Liquid and electricity don’t mix. It is generally a case of moving quickly to ensure water doesn’t get into the internal casing.</p>

<p>Everything seemed fine until it started running and then shut off. I spilled a half full cup of coffee on my hp laptop this morning. Water is less problematic than coffee or soda, because it can naturally evaporate and leave. The circuits will short out if even a drop of water touches it. It got all over the keyboard, so i rushed for napkins.the screen went black and i turned the computer off and unplugged it, disconnected my ipod, dried everything the best i could. If you have a removable battery, remove it.</p>
