<p>Charlene, if you are asking about substituting regular coffee powder for espresso powder in the chocolate cake, you can omit the espresso or some people have used a cup of a really strong hot coffee instead of the espresso and boiling water. In your jug with 100ml water, add your instant coffee of choice and sugar and stir it well to dissolve. Helpful when in a rush in the morning or before heading out to work out so i have more stamina. This is my formula for a quick energy boost. In a pitcher or shaker filled with ice, pour the espresso or coffee mixture over the ice, followed by the vodka. But because every espresso machine is different, you may start to home in on your ideal dose.</p>
<h3 id="just-mix-cold-water--instant-coffee-grounds--your-creamer-of-choice-or-drink-it-black-and-you-have-instant-iced-coffee">Just mix cold water + instant coffee grounds + your creamer of choice (or drink it black), and you have instant iced coffee.</h3>
<p>Start with 30ml fresh espresso/coffee in one part of the boston tin without ice. Boil the milk and water together. Add a few drops of water (just enough to incorporate the coffee powder in to form a thick paste) stir vigorously with a spoon and soon you will see that the coffe and sugar form a whitish shiny paste. For a double shot of espresso (about 2 ounces), a standard dose is between 13 and 18 grams of coffee. Mix 2 teaspoons of instant coffee with 1⁄2 cup (120 ml) of hot water. Heat the water in the microwave for 30 seconds to 1 minute.</p>
