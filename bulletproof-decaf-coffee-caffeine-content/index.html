<p>Bulletproof coffee is the ultimate drink for power brokers and schoolteachers alike. Bulletproof coffee, aka butter coffee or keto coffee, is an energizing beverage made with quality fats. This is one of the most expensive decafs on my list though! However, this is much less than the amount found in regular coffee. That all changed when the best way to make decaf coffee was blended with the best coffee beans to make upgradedâ„¢ decaffeinated coffee beans. I went caffeine free for 30 days and never felt better.</p>
