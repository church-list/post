<p><strong>Espresso Beans Vs Regular Coffee Beans</strong>. Next, let’s compare the beans used for ‘regular’ coffee to what we think of as espresso beans. Here are the steps to follow to have an espresso with regular coffee beans: Espresso beans tend to be a little oilier than any other type of coffee bean. Espresso requires a very fine grind which isn’t suitable for regular coffee brewing methods, but if you grind your coffee beans to a coarser size, there’s no reason why you can’t brew them any way you like.</p>

<p>Here are the best espresso beans. While there are different types and blends of espresso bean, the most basic difference is between the lighter arabica and darker robusta. Espresso and regular coffee originally come from the same type of bean. It’s all in the preparation! The big difference is that they are made from two different ways of preparation and the way the coffee beans are roasted and ground. Espresso beans are dark roasted almost by definition.</p>

<p>Light, medium, and dark roasted beans can use for regular coffee. The water can’t do this as easily with coarser grounds. When comparing regular coffee beans to those labeled “espresso”, i never really understood why an espresso bag is often more expensive than a regular coffee bean bag. Espresso beans vs coffee beans: Generally, coffee and espresso have two species, arabica and robusta. Making espresso also requires extremely hot and pressurized water.</p>
