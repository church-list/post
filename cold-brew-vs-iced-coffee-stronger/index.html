<p><strong>Cold Brew Vs Iced Coffee Stronger</strong>. What we can say for certain is the cold brew has the potential to be much stronger than iced coffee. All you have to do is brew ground coffee with hot water around 200 degrees fahrenheit, allowing the heat to pull out the flavor and caffeine in the coffee beans. However, cold brew is made as a concentrate that should be diluted with one part coffee to one part water or milk, which brings that caffeine level right back down. Because the coffee grounds are in longer contact with the water, cold brew contains more caffeine than iced coffee.</p>

<p>Cold brew is different from traditional iced coffee — which is just hot brewed coffee poured over ice — in that it’s made by mixing coffee grounds and cold water and letting it sit for a much longer extraction time. Cold brewing, however, involves immersing grounds in cold water from the start. The key point here is that often cold brew will be the stronger coffee, both in terms of flavor and in terms of caffeine. The cold brew coffee has a smoother taste, with lesser acid and bitterness. Iced coffee has lower caffeine content and is lighter as compared to cold brew coffee. It’s definitely the worst method for brewing iced coffee, but that doesn’t stop fast food chains from saving money on hot coffee that isn’t purchased by turning it into iced coffee.</p>
