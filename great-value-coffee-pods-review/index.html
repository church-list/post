<p>This could be due to the amount of coffee they contain: These medium roast pods rank as great tasting buddies. Check that the pods are compatible with your machine! We have used great value coffee pods for the last year but recently have had issues with the coffee exploding in the single cup side, thought it was the coffee maker, called that company told them what was happening, they helped as much as they could and ended up doing. These best value coffees often sell out quickly and may no longer be available. Simply place the pod in your brewing system and with the touch of a button, in a few moments, you will have a relaxing and decadent cup of warm coffee.</p>
