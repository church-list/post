<p>Role of roasting conditions in the profile of volatile flavor chemicals formed from coffee beans. Is it true that roasting coffee can release dangerous airborne chemicals? It is a legal entity registered by the ministry of foreign trade. Coffee contains a high amount of chlorogenic acid, which roasting breaks down into caffeic and quinic acid. Roasting causes chemical changes to take place as the beans are rapidly brought to very high temperatures. Although most roasting takes place above 540 °f (282 °c), it is well into “second crack” (city ++) that oils start to migrate from inside to outside, hence the darker, oily appearing bean for long hot roasts.</p>
