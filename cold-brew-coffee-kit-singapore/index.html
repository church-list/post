<p><strong>Cold Brew Coffee Kit Singapore</strong>. Based in singapore, our team and coffee roaster is a member and certified by the specialty association of europe (scae), an international professional body for specialty coffee. Make your own cold brew at home, or send a diy cold brew kit to someone who could do with one. The beloved beverage can be made with items ranging from a french press to a mason jar, and its two main brewing methods involve steeping coffee grounds in cold water anywhere from 12 to 24 hours or using a drip style. Upon introduction to this $17 kit, ina says she was “totally hooked,” noting that without the gizmo, making iced coffee or cold brew at home can “be seriously messy and cumbersome.”</p>
