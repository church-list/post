<p><strong>Ninja Coffee Maker Descaling Solution</strong>. During this cycle, the descaling solution runs through all the tubes of the coffee machine and breaks up the calcium deposited. Ninja�s specially formulated solution removes naturally occurring calcium buildup and other impurities that could affect the flavor of your coffee and the performance of your brewer. After the process of descaling the ninja coffee bar, there will be a sign flashing “flush” on the clock timer screen. You should run this clean cycle as soon as the clean light on your machine turns on to keep your coffee maker working at its best.</p>

To use the scaling solution, follow the instructions on the label.</p>
