<p><strong>Coffee Flavored Ice Cream Cake</strong>. In a medium bowl, whisk the cream and sugar until the sugar has dissolved completely and the mixture is frothy. ‚òï chocolate brownie cake with coffee flavored ice cream topped with sliced almonds and crushed chocolate chip cookie sprinkled with coffee for extra kick of caffeine. You want the ice cream to soften but not melt, so just keep an eye on it. I‚Äôm not sure if it was the little chunks of chocolate scattered throughout the ice cream or the green color that i found so alluring.</p>
