<p>Barissimo dark roast is the closest i have come. It comes in 2 varieties (original and french roast), and runs $7.49 for a 32 oz bottle. Aldi is constantly expanding its organic lines and has organic food at such great prices. It is a remarkably good coffee, but it does not duplicate the french flavor, nor does it claim to. This little cold brew coffee system ran just $9.99 as an aldi find, and i’m definitely going to be using mine all summer long. I have tried a number of french roasts and dark coffees, but none seem to have that french flavor.</p>

<p>Barissimo cold brew coffee concentrate hit the aldi find shelves a few weeks ago, but i just picked up one for myself a couple in the past couple days. The barissimo line features nine bagged and single serve coffee items, along with additional seasonal and special buy items (that will be available for a limited time). I brewed my pot of coffee with 1 rounded tablespoon for every cup of water and then added one for the pot. I also made this cinnamon bun iced coffee. Barissimo iced coffee until our love affair with aldi, we were spending almost $5 a cup at the coffee shop down the street. 0 12/14/2020 total views :</p>
