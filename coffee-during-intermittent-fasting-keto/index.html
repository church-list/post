<p><strong>Coffee During Intermittent Fasting Keto</strong>. But if you’ve been doing keto for a while, you might realize, a black coffee or tea is all you need in the morning (you’re also likely to be much less hungry so you don’t need to add fat and can do a real intermittent fast until lunchtime!), and you’re able to access your own body fat for energy instead of first using the fat you’re. Because keto coffee doesn�t contain any carbohydrates that will cause an insulin response, it�s also perfect to have during your fasted period while following the complete intermittent fasting bundle protocols. The same applies to decaffeinated coffee. Drinking coffee with butter while intermittent fasting will not break your fast or knock you out of ketosis.</p>
