<p><strong>French Press Coffee Ratio</strong>. You will need the pot, a method for measuring volume, such as a liquid measuring cup, and enough water to fill the pot. As a reference, a standard coffee mug will hold 12 oz fluid ounces. A typical coffee mug can hold up to 12 fluid ounces.

<p>While there�s a maximum amount that your french press will make, there isn�t really a minimum. Our preferred french press ratio. Depending on the size of your french press, you can brew as little as 4 fluid ounces of coffee to as many fluid ounces as you need. You may confidently start with it to get middle strength coffee. Which roughly works out as 2 tablespoons of coffee per cup, and 8 tablespoons of coffee per large 1 liter/32 oz french press. You can use a ratio of anywhere from 1:7, all the way to 1:20.</p>
<h3 id="which-roughly-works-out-as-2-tablespoons-of-coffee-per-cup-and-8-tablespoons-of-coffee-per-large-1-liter32-oz-french-press">Which roughly works out as 2 tablespoons of coffee per cup, and 8 tablespoons of coffee per large 1 liter/32 oz french press.</h3>
<p>Add coffee grounds and then zero out or tare your scale. Decide how much brewed coffee you want to make and weigh out the right amount of coffee. Some french presses class 4 oz as a single cup but this is bananas to me, i’d just be getting into a cup of coffee as it was finished with a coffee that small. The ratio of the weight of the ground coffee to the weight of the finished coffee is 1:17, i.e., 57 grams (2 oz) of grounds per 1 liter (33 fl oz) of water. A process whereby the individual coffee granules are completely suspended in water for the entire duration of the extraction process and generally aren’t removed. Our preferred french press ratio.</p>
