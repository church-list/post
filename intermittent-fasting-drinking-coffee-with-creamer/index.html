While some if diets might call for zero coffee during a fasting period, sneaking in a cup or two won‚Äôt totally undo the benefits (as long as it‚Äôs black coffee). Now as for coffee creamers, adding one teaspoon of heavy cream to your coffee doesn‚Äôt seem to have a negative impact on fasting, according to studies ( 7 ). Drinking coffee with sweet creamer when intermittent fasting</p>

<p>If cream in your coffee makes it easier for you to stretch out the time between meals, then it is helping, not hurting. Therefore, you are advised not to have sugar, creamer, or even natural additions like honey to your coffee. On a 16/8 intermittent fasting schedule, you are allowed to drink black coffee ‚òï without milk and sugar while fasting. Find out what gets the green light and what doesn‚Äôt. If you prefer your coffee with cream and sugar, thatÔøΩs still on the menu with the 5:2 intermittent fasting method. If you think you can stick to intermittent fasting by just having a tablespoon or so of creamer, by all means add it.</p>
