<p>Organic mocha java whole bean coffee blend 6. Mocha java is the world’s original coffee blend. Our mocha java is a true blend of yemen mocha and indonesian java arabica beans creating the classic combination that may be one of the oldest blends known. The history of coffee grown on java began in 1690 when the dutch were finally able to smuggle coffee plants out of the arab port of mocha and quickly began growing it in java, which was an east indian. Heavy and potent, this adaptation of the traditional blend packs a punch without being too bitter. Produces a full bodied cup, with earthy and fruity notes.</p>
