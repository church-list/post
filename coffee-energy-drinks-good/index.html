<p><strong>Coffee Energy Drinks Good</strong>. When you drink a cup of caffeinated coffee, your central nervous system perks up, which controls the majority of your body and mind. The nice thing about tea is that you won’t crash as fast or hard as coffee, and you can avoid the coffee jitters. Both are stimulants that provide energy, help attentiveness and increase concentration. That’s one small coffee versus two large coffees, give or take.</p>

<p>Coffee appeals more to the older generations. Energy drinks can contain high levels of caffeine but are unlikely to be hazardous unless consumed with alcohol. But again, it�s not something you would �notice� consciously, unless you drank a lot of coffee. The caffeine amount is about the same. You can even make healthy natural beverages that boost your energy and come packed with other. Energy drinks are �marketed� in such a way that you expect them to have a massive effect on you, but they�re just drinks.</p>

<p>Some of the more powerful ones contain a whopping 300 mg of caffeine, which has the possibility of raising the dead (not confirmed, we are still researching that). Below, you can find 9 of them. Energy drinks are also helpful if you need an energy boost for a specific project, such as studying for an exam or finishing a presentation. Jokes aside, there is much to be said about the power of energy drinks. However, coffee does have health benefits over energy drinks. We may have completely different results.</p>
