<p>I call it a filter because it prevents the coffee grounds from entering the pot. I don’t mean that in a negative manner, but they utilize suction to brew the coffee. Remove the coffee filter, which should have some residue on it from the mineral deposits the vinegar has broken up inside your coffee machine’s water reservoir. All the grounds get thoroughly saturated, lending to a consistent extraction. I have it on a high heat to get the water up the filter and in to the top chamber, then add all my coffee and wait 1:45, before stirring more and removing the heat. A vacuum brewing device uses the temperature changes in water and the resultant vaporizing of water to both brew and filter coffee.</p>
