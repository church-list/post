<p><strong>Coffee Bean Origin Country</strong>. / coffee by country of origin. In late september requested that the agency decide whether the united states or canada would be the country of origin for the roasted coffee it imports. By 1970, coffee growing made up 50% of el salvador’s gdp. El salvador is a pretty small country, so it makes sense that its coffee industry is on the small side as well.</p>

<p>Coffee grown worldwide can trace its heritage back centuries to the ancient coffee forests on the ethiopian plateau. In some growing regions coffee farmers still harvest beans from wild coffee tree forests. Around the 10th century, several indigenous ethiopian tribes ate coffee in something similar to porridge.

Additionally, for some coffee drinkers, tasting coffee that is grown and roasted in the same country will be a more authentic experience. The earliest substantiated evidence of either coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree is from the early 15th century, in the sufi monasteries of yemen, spreading soon to mecca and medina.</p>
