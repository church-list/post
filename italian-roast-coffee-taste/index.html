<p><strong>Italian Roast Coffee Taste</strong>. Hints of the fruity and floral taste make for a cup coffee that tastes way more expensive than it. The age of the coffee, the processing method, the grind, and the brewing method will also affect the taste. Italian roasts are quite rare in specialty coffee because no matter what coffee you choose to roast, an italian roast will pretty much always taste the same. The darker the roast, the bitterer or more burnt the taste becomes.</p>

<p>29 to figure it out!. A bean from ethiopia will taste differently than a bean from india, even if they are both french roast.
