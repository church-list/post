<p>Personally, i�d buy the 1k bean. The coffee bean can only be bought from the travelling cart at a steep price and generally comes at a major loss of revenue to farmers (unless they plan on growing coffee beans en masse for spring and summer). One coffee plant yields 4(+) coffee beans every 2 days, which can then be planted and grown into additional coffee plants. It can be used in a cooking recipe to make, well, coffee, and also in the maintenance of fish ponds. They have a rare chance to drop from dust sprites (about 1%). The sell prices for artisan goods are handled by template:artisan.</p>
