<p><strong>Half And Half Substitute Coffee Creamer</strong>. When even a little bit of half and half made me feel sick, i had a hard time handling it. No, i wouldn�t, but then i wouldn�t use those coffee creamer things for anything except perhaps lubricating machinery, if there was nothing else available. Another vegan alternative for half and half, soy creamer can be created by blending silken tofu with unsweetened soy milk at equal amounts. Pasteurized grade a milk, cream.</p>

<p>It really made the perfect cup of coffee. I like to put about 1/4 cup of creamer into 14 oz. Use it to complete coffee, top off tea and more! Foods marketed as coffee creamers are often unhealthy. So creamy half &amp; half lovers won’t know what hit ‘em. For many people, what passes for coffee is really just a fancy.</p>

<p>Coconut milk is an excellent alternative to the creamer as it only has 7 grams of sugar in one cup compared to 15ml of coffee mate’s coffee creamer, which has 5g of sugar and 1.5g of fat. Taste it and adjust the ingredients to suit your taste. Milk is traditionally used for tea since tea has far fewer dissolved solids and is thinner. It adds milk ingredients and it adds butterfat. If you need flavor, there�s plenty of great sugar free syrups out there, stevia, or straight cocoa powder.
