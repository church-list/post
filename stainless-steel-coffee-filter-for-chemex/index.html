The able kone is a reusable stainless steel coffee filter which fits with the included 6 cup (30oz) chemex (as well as the 8 cup or 10 cup versions). There is no need for paper filters. One of the most important aspects of a metal filter is the retention of oils in your coffee. First of all, the design language of this pour over filter is the key concern.</p>

<p>There is no need for paper filters. My husband said, “free coffee!” yuk. The microscopic holes in this filter allows the coffee to leave the filter leaving the grounds in the filter. It did improve the flow situation greatly, but the filter was still brown. It also allows the nutrients and flavor oil to pass through, unlike the case with paper coffee filters. It can easily fit chemex coffee makers that can make 6.</p>
