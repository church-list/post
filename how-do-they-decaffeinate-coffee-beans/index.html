<p><strong>How Do They Decaffeinate Coffee Beans</strong>. Next, the beans are transferred to another container and immersed in coffee oils that were obtained from spent coffee grounds and left to soak. Keep that precious water safe.

<p>But coffee beans obtained from coffee plants are actually green in color. Swelling the green coffee beans with water or steam so the caffeine can be extracted extracting the caffeine from the beans.this is done with water, a solvent or activated carbon. In the swiss water process, the green coffee beans are soaked in hot water to remove the caffeine and compounds responsible for much of the flavor of the coffee flavor. Get yourself a load of green, unroasted, coffee beans. The solvent is then recaptured in an evaporator, and the beans are washed with water. There are three main ways to decaffeinate coffee and they all start with the green, or unroasted, coffee bean.</p>

<p>The water is then drained through a charcoal filter. The green coffee is soaked in water to open the bean’s “pores”, beginning the decaffeination process whereby caffeine molecules are able to move in and out of the beans. So, the result is a second batch of decaffeinated coffee full of flavours. Green coffee beans are soaked in a hot water/coffee solution to draw the caffeine to the surface of the beans. The water is then drained through a charcoal filter. The liquid solvent is circulated through a bed of moist, green coffee beans, removing some of the caffeine;</p>
