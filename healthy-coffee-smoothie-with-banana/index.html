<p><strong>Healthy Coffee Smoothie With Banana</strong>. It’s packed with protein for muscle repair, potassium for electrolytes, and water for hydration. This chocolate banana coffee smoothie is the perfect treat when you are trying to eat healthy but still have a sweet tooth! Because you use frozen banana in this coffee smoothie recipe, you don�t need any ice cubes. Not that this peanut butter banana smoothie isn’t, but i’d consider it more of a snack smoothie than a breakfast smoothie.</p>

Make it without banana by subbing in 1/4 cup of coconut milk and adding a few ice cubes. This healthy coffee smoothie is really the breakfast of possibilities, friends! Perfect for a quick and healthy breakfast or a post workout drink, and can be made with instant or brewed coffee. Smoothies are always popular on my website and for good reason: Add protein to your smoothie by adding a spoonful of nut butter (like almond or peanut butter), or by adding a scoop of protein powder.</p>
