<p><strong>Is Decaf Coffee Acidic Or Alkaline</strong>. That being said, all coffee causes the stomach to produce acid and the scientific results of the effect of both types of coffee on this are inconclusive. They become more neutral when mixed with a base (alkaline). The acidity is from the caffeine content, not the coffee itself. There are medium roast regular and decaf versions available.</p>
