Since many dog owners might not realize that caffeine is harmful, they might not be aware of some of the common sources pets have access to it. How much is too much depends on many factors, such as the size of your pets and whether your dog only lapped the coffee or actually ingested coffee grounds, which contain a much higher amount of caffeine. The symptoms of coffee toxicity are similar to the symptoms of chocolate toxicity, and just as serious, if not more so. The side effects of coffee tree poisoning are nausea, vomiting, depression, and contact dermatitis if the sap gets on the skin.</p>
