<p><strong>Coffee Old Fashioned How To Drink</strong>. Thank you to mr black for sponsoring todays episode and for the great idea to make a cold brew old fashioned! Warm on low heat and gently stir until the sugar is dissolved (do not bring to a boil). In a mixing glass, combine the bourbon, coffee liqueur, brown sugar syrup, and dash of chocolate bitters. The old fashioned is one of my personal after hour favourites, so i’m not altering it just because i feel like it.</p>
