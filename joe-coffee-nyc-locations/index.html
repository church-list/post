<p>Cafe grumpy is a great local spot for your daily cup of joe. I�m a dog walker/ex resident of the neighborhood &amp; let me just say this place is a most welcome edition to the area. In the interest of the safety of our employees and customers, we are temporarily closed. Joe nyc was founded by a group of prominent new york city community development corporations in response to a set of challenges confronting new york city’s affordable housing stock and low and moderate income communities, and, in particular the nonprofit. Joe opened its first location in the village in 2003 and today has 18 nyc locations, as well as two in philly. We think we have the best coffee in the world, and we think you�ll agree.</p>
