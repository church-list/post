<p><strong>How Much Is A Venti Iced Coffee At Starbucks</strong>. To add to the confusion, if you order a cold venti coffee drink, the cup size is 24 ounces (709 milliliters), presumably to allow room for ice. Venti hot which is 20 fluid ounces and venti cold which is 24 fluid ounces. This name makes sense until you realize that none of the smaller portions have names that are numerically related to the size. The starbucks venti contains 20 ounces.</p>
