<p>Mount hagen coffee is packed in germany, but it’s not like anyone is growing coffee in upstate new york. Organic processing methods allow you to achieve a delicate and pleasant taste with the preservation of natural supplements that are beneficial to health. There aren’t local options for beans here (although there are local roasters, and i do like to support them whenever possible). A sip of our rich, smooth coffee is a taste of its pampered history in the paradise of mount hagen, papua new guinea. On top, mount hagen coffee is fair trade, which means, the coffee farmers get a fair price for their coffee growing efforts. It has a rich, complex taste that is special for any coffee, not just instant.</p>
