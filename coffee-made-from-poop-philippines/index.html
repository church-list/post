Sold for up to $160 per pound, coffee alamid is officially the world’s most expensive brew made from cat excrement. The beans are then dried, roasted, ground and brewed. A spectacular cup of coffee.

<p>That product came about after much fuss was made over cat poop coffee (or, kopi luwak) which is made from beans eaten and digested by palm civets, or toddy cats. It’s the world’s most expensive coffee, and it’s made from poop. From the simple drip or regular brewed coffee, we now enjoy several new flavors that appeal to our varied tastes. Today, her brand caters to coffee shops in seattle, new york, chicago, san francisco, and manila. Passionate for exotic coffee the kopi luwak coffee aroma is strong and rich, with a full body flavor that is close to syrupy. After a digestion process of around 24 hours, the undigested coffee beans are excreted in the civet�s poop.</p>
