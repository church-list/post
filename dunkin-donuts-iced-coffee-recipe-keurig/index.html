<p><strong>Dunkin Donuts Iced Coffee Recipe Keurig</strong>. I have tried to make iced coffee before but it never tasted like my favorite from dunkin donuts! That may sound like a lot, but that’s how we do it at dunkin’, and guests love it! If i’m feeling particularly decadent, i’ll add a dollop of whipped cream and a sprinkling of toasted, unsweetened coconut flakes. That’s a huge plus for me!</p>
