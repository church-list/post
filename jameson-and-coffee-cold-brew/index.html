<p><strong>Jameson And Coffee Cold Brew</strong>. This is a perfectly balanced combination of our smooth irish whiskey with hints of toasted oak, dark chocolate and a rich coffee aroma. Jameson irish whiskey has always been a triple distilled irish whiskey. The result is a smooth and distinctive beverage with intense coffee aromatics, complemented by the vanilla nuttiness of jameson, with notes of toasted oak and dark chocolate. Jameson’s new cold brew will contain 17mg of caffeine per shot of whiskey, which is pretty decent.</p>

<p>Whiskey and coffee have always flirted with each other in the form of spiked coffees and espresso martinis, but over the last few years. It�s nicely balanced with aromas and flavours of coffee, toasted oak, dark chocolate caramel, spice and vanilla. Fill glass with ice, almost to the top, you don�t want it to poke through the cream head; That process ensures a smooth sip each and every time. Pour fresh cream into shaker; That means in addition to getting a little buzzed, you’ll be way more alert as well.</p>
