<p>Nevertheless, almond milk technically breaks the fast. Let’s take a look at coffee—the beverage we see the most questions about—through that lens. (there’s a big difference between a tablespoon of almond milk added to black coffee and the half cup needed to make a latte, too!).

Water, coffee, tea, broths, apple cider vinegar and unsweetened almond milk are some of the drinks you can have during intermittent fasting.

<p>Coffee, together with tea, is among the top intermittent fasting drinks that… aren’t water. I’ve been practicing intermittent fasting for over a year now and it has helped me stay regulated, reduced acid reflux, and has lessened my stomach/digestion pain.

This makes increased concentration another perk of intermittent fasting with coffee.</p>
