<p>As a novelist, memoirist, essayist, and anthology editor, writing short stories is a new experience for me. Kaave helps you with cup readings by its unique approach. Coffee is a popular beverage consumed all over the world. The way this app works is very simple. Until now, tasseography (or tasseomancy) is the academic term for turkish coffee fortune telling. Reading coffee grounds in a coffee cup reading, the psychic advisor interprets the residual coffee grounds in the cup and on the saucer.</p>
<h3 id="coffee-grounds-are-highly-acidic-so-spread-them-generously-over-the-flower-beds-of-acid-loving-plants-such-as-azaleas-rhododendrons-and-hydrangeas-for-amazing-blooms">Coffee grounds are highly acidic, so spread them generously over the flower beds of acid loving plants, such as azaleas, rhododendrons, and hydrangeas, for amazing blooms!</h3>
<p>To get your reading, click on 3 coffee cups and enjoy your free coffee cup reading. Part of “fortune telling” in general, and coffee cup reading in particular, is tuning into the “vibes” of the subject. For coffee readings you need a strong turkish coffee, without sugar, milk or other additives! The way this app works is very simple. Coffee grounds are loaded with phosphorous, potassium, magnesium and copper. In the balkans and turkey, a favorite pass time is drinking turkish coffee followed by having your fortune told from the leftover coffee grounds in the cup.</p>
