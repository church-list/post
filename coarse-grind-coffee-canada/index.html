<p><strong>Coarse Grind Coffee Canada</strong>. When brewing requires that the coffee grounds are exposed to heated water for a longer period of time, as with a coffee percolator, a coarser brew is required. Coffee mills (sometimes also referred to as electric blade grinders, whirly grinders, or propeller grinders) chop up coffee beans into smaller particles as opposed to grinding them. Beans that are too finely ground for this method of brewing will often produce a harsh, bitter taste, but an overly coarse grind will have the opposite. Fine grind is for home brewers, coarse grind is for professional machines, bodems and pour overs.</p>
