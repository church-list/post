<p>If coffee filter paper doesn�t possess enough strength, it will tear or rupture, allowing coffee grains to collect in the coffee pot. Put the v60 coffee dripper on the coffee server or the drip stand, if you’re going to use one. Getting a bit more into the particulars of it, you could technically say that something like a french. Put the coffee server on the scale. You can also select regular or bold coffee without changing the amount of grounds used. It can make up to 14 cups of coffee for a crowd or just one cup for those mornings when that’s all you need.</p>
