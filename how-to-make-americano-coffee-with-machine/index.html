<p>Coffee lovers who enjoy a velvety and creamy texture love to make the latte. The steps are quite similar, but you need to add the water into the aeropress and give it a stir. The word “latte” is the shortened version of how the italians call it, which is caffe latte, meaning milk coffee. Pull a 3oz (or more if you like your drink stronger) espresso shot into a separate glass. But if you’re looking at americano as being a concentrated coffee that’s mixed with a lot of hot water, then you can adapt that definition to suit your needs. As for the raw materials, all you really need are shots of good espresso coffee and hot water.</p>
<h3 id="the-original-americano-coffee-uses-freshly-brewed-espresso-and-authentic-espresso-can-only-come-from-an-espresso-machine">The original americano coffee uses freshly brewed espresso, and authentic espresso can only come from an espresso machine.</h3>
<p>The pixie gives you the option to make either espresso or lungo coffee automatically. If you’re unsure of the strength of your americano, ask you barista how many shots of espresso are included in the drink. It doesn’t matter whether this is an espresso machine which uses a portafilter to load the coffee into the machine or a fully automatic coffee machine or a nespresso or keurig. To make an americano, heat fresh water in a kettle until it boils. That said, you can make an americano with your espresso machine. Easy americano coffee without coffee machine.</p>
