<p><strong>Is Blonde Roast Coffee Strong</strong>. But in the new world of specialty coffee, things are very different. A cup of blonde roast brewed coffee will taste nuttier, less bitter, and more acidity than other roasts.

Which is true, the blonde roast is the same thing as a light roast, just roasted at the lowest possible temperature.</p>

<p>Does blonde roast coffee have more caffeine? Featured dark roast is a hot drink as well, so you’ll notice that the temperature of the drink doesn’t really matter when gauging the caffeine content. You may have noticed that starbucks sells a few different blends of brewed coffee, from their pike place medium roast to their blonde light roast — whereas the pike place tastes a bit stronger.

<p>If you want to know what a blonde coffee at starbucks is, then it’s advertised as being a mellower, less bitter coffee or espresso, which may make it a great choice for those who don’t drink a lot of coffee. But in the new world of specialty coffee, things are very different. Blonde roast coffee is a style of roasting beans which has the lightest color and can be likened to overcooking a steak. Because the bold, strong flavors found in a darker roast are often mistaken for an increase in caffeine content. This coffee has a high acidity, and it gave the sour aftertaste. Light roast, on the other hand, has a sweeter taste.</p>
