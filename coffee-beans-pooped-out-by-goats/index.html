<p>Or rather, it‚Äôs made from coffee beans that are partially digested and then pooped out by the civet, a catlike creature. And these quirky little goats have no qualms about scampering out on branches, 30 feet off the ground, in search of the treeÔøΩs bitter fruit. Farmers traditionally used to collect the animalÔøΩs waste and scour it for coffee beans as a way. Legend has it that in the 9th century there was a goat herder named kaldi who discovered the benefits of coffee, because of his goats. Where, in the second weird animal story of this post, a goatherd noticed his goats got hyper after eating the deep red fruit of a wild tree ‚Äî and tried it out for himself. Even more unusual for coffee, the beans were collected from the helpful elephants of thailand‚Äôs golden triangle elephant foundation.</p>

Where, in the second weird animal story of this post, a goatherd noticed his goats got hyper after eating the deep red fruit of a wild tree ‚Äî and tried it out for himself. There are two reasons you would want to pay an exorbitant amount of money to drink coffee made from beans digested by thai elephants. It comes from beans that have been partially digested and shit out by wild cats known as sumatran civets. There are lots of different stories about the beginning of the coffee bean.</p>
