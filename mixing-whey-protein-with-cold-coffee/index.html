<p><strong>Mixing Whey Protein With Cold Coffee</strong>. If you’re trying to build some lean muscle, you can simply add whey protein to your iced coffee. Milk or milk substitute (use as little or as much as you prefer to add to. The protein mixed very well, actually much better than the clear whey (i still love the clear whey protein). Here’s a recipe to make this shake in a basic shaker bottle.</p>

<p>If you’re trying to build some lean muscle, you can simply add whey protein to your iced coffee. The protein powder will add sweetness. To avoid this, mix into a paste using water at room temperature. Just throw the coffee in a blender with ice, almond milk, and both chocolate and vanilla protein powders. Since whey protein is designed to mix in cold liquid, the trick is to mix the protein into some cold water first, and then add it to the coffee. A shaker bottle works perfectly).</p>

<p>Make your coffee and then add the paste. Make your coffee and then add the paste. Usually i�d go with 8 oz of iced coffee, 8 oz milk, two scoops protein. Downsides to putting protein powder in coffee. This makes a good tasting coffee. I have only tried mixing it with water and found the flavor to closely resemble coffee, but a bit sweeter.</p>
