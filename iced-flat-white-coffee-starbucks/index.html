<p>Select a store to view availability The process as our intrepid starbucks pro aubrey explained, one of the key differences between the flat white and your standard latte or cappuccino is that the flat white is made with whole milk. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. This iced flat white—intentionally made with almondmilk and starbucks blonde® espresso roast poured over ice with a hint of honey—creates a perfect amount of cool, creamy, nutty sweetness. In starbucks cafés, the flat white is made with an extra shot of ristretto espresso. Take a look and see what makes each one unique.</p>

<p>As you can see, using skim milk you can enjoy a coffee for relatively fewer calories, but once you use full cream milk, the calorie counts start ticking up(of course). From now on i shall call that “the good flat white.” and yes, i know that starbucks flat whites aren’t real flat whites blah blah whatever coffee snobbery etc. The process as our intrepid starbucks pro aubrey explained, one of the key differences between the flat white and your standard latte or cappuccino is that the flat white is made with whole milk. Do not get it iced! The difference is in the way they’re crafted. Ristretto shots of starbucks blonde® espresso—which is subtly smooth without the roasty edge—get the perfect amount of whole milk and ice, creating a cup that�s not too strong, not too creamy, but just right.</p>
