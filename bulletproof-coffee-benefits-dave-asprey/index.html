<p>Asprey helped popularize the understanding that our brains need quality fat to function properly. But are there any bulletproof coffee benefits? I read how dave suggested that two of the main benefits of bulletproof® coffee would be: Bulletproof�s founder and ceo, and father of biohacking, dave asprey gives us the low down on prebiotics and overall health.

<p>Dave asprey plans to live until he is 180 years old. Bulletproof coffee, also known as butter coffee, is a high calorie drink made with added fats, intended to fuel your start to the day. Coffee rejected by places with high mold standards, like europe and japan, are redirected to the u.s. It was created by the originator of the bulletproof diet, dave asprey, an american entrepreneur and author. The improved memory and brain function is what i was gunning for, so that week i got some butter and started the journey. For sale because the fda’s standards for mold and toxin contamination are some of the lowest in the world.</p>
