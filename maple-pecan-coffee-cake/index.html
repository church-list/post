<p><strong>Maple Pecan Coffee Cake</strong>. 3/4 cup pecan pieces 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed and chilled. Maple pecan snack cake is a dessert that is perfect for all fans of maple flavor with an added bonus of pecans in every bite! 50 ml (2 fl oz) pure maple syrup. Ease—i’d say this cake falls between beginner and intermediate.you’ll need to toast the pecans and make “sand” with the butter, but combining the ingredients is pretty simple.</p>

I decided to change the recipe slightly by making a coffee cake instead of a regular vanilla one and the flavours worked so well.</p>
