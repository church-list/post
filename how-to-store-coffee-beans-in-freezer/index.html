<p>If you buy coffee beans in bulk, freezing them can extend their shelf life by two months. In order to ensure that your beans are fresh, do not store them in the freezer longer than two weeks from the purchase date. They argue that the moisture that leaks out of the beans when they start to thaw can ruin your grinder, so it�s best to take that step before freezing. Don’t leave it in there for more than 2 months Take out only as much coffee as you need and never return beans that have thawed to the freezer. After all, the whole reason modern civilization uses electric refrigeration methods is because cold temperatures preserve food.</p>

Then specialty coffee came along and said it was evil. Your coffee storage solutions should prevent either from getting at your coffee beans.</p>
