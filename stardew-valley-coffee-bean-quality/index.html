<p>Oct 8, 2016 @ 11:08pm coffee has no quality? For that one, you must be actually facing the keg to place the 5 beans. It can be sold at a base price of 15g, 18g for the silver quality, and 22g for the gold quality. The crop takes 10 days to grow and you will recieve 5 per harvest. When consumed, it grants the player +1 speed for 1m 23s. They seem to be a common drop from dust sprites now, or maybe i�m just having especially good luck on my rng lately.</p>
<h3 id="when-consumed-it-grants-the-player-1-speed-for-1m-23s">When consumed, it grants the player +1 speed for 1m 23s.</h3>
<p>So 36 coffee beans from 1 coffee bean. Again, personally i�d buy it. The speed of the player’s horse is also increased. When harvested it will 4 beans. In other words, you normally get four beans per harvest, but fertilizer only affects one of them each time. As a drink, its buff stacks with any food buffs (including speed), but replaces.</p>
