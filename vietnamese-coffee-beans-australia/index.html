<p><strong>Vietnamese Coffee Beans Australia</strong>. I purchased 2 kilos of trung nguyen blend 7 coffee beans in hcmc and brought it home to australia. Shop our range of trung ngyuen ground coffee, high quality phin filters and gift packs. Che phin 2 vietnamese style coffee from trung nguyen is a blend of the finest robusta and arabica coffee beans from the buon ma thuot coffee region. The coffee produced from vietnamese coffee beans is notoriously strong and dark, which might account for the need to sweeten it with rich, smooth condensed milk.</p>

<p>Coffee should be pressed tightly. To all you coffee connoisseurs out there that can tell the difference between your robusta and your arabica, where to find brisbane�s best vietnamese iced coffee is for you. I was recommended to try old saigon coffee. Today vietnam’s coffee is not only known for its output in the top world, but also for creating a very unique coffee culture of the vietnamese people. They are a cofee bean importer based in melbourne suburbs. The vietnamese coffee was rich, flavorful, sweet and perfect on a cool day, but the method for brewing and serving the coffee is what really impressed me.</p>

<p>�trung nguyen� brand is my preferred vietnamese coffee. That�s what make vietnamese coffee style unique and special. Drinking vietnamese coffee is a special experience, watching the coffee drip through the specialised phin filter and into condensed milk in the bottom of a glass is a truly magical experience. The coffee beans are roasted fresh in small batches to ensure an even and regular roast for each coffee origin. Brew coffee with water using your preferred method to make brewed coffee. They roast the beans in small batches in melbourne, and sell online.</p>

<p>The traditional way of making a vietnamese coffee is by using a special vietnamese coffee filter, called a phin.it’s a cheap and flimsy contraption made of aluminium, easily found at most asian grocery stores, but i have also seen more fancy and upmarket stainless steel versions sold in some specialty stores.</p>
