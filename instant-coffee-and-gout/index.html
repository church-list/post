<p>The impact of a moderate consumption of an instant coffee on the general composition of the human intestinal bacterial population was assessed in this study. Some varieties of coffee contain more natural acids than others. This particular study also suggests that the more coffee a person drinks, the more decrease in the reduction of the risk of gout attack. The authors found that men who drank four to five cups of coffee a day had a 40 percent lower relative risk of gout compared to men who weren’t coffee drinkers. However, there is also a genetic predisposition as well. A can of cola contains about one third of that.</p>
