<p><strong>Mug That Keeps Coffee Hot For Hours</strong>. It�s made of stainless steel and features triple insulation, keeping drinks hot for three hours. (most of us, after all, can drink a 16 oz beverage in fewer than six hours). Along with this coffee mug, you can get the right temperature insulation. The best thermal mugs have been designed to hold in the heat for up to six hours, and some can keep your coffee hot and steamy for the best part of a day!</p>

<p>The difference is in the insulated silicone boot that will help to keep your coffee hot for as long as you need it to. Its handle works well for right and left handed people, and being vacuum insulated allows it to keep coffee hot for up to five hours. This two in one travel mug is a coffee/tea french press and a thermos all in one sleek piece. Up to eight hours size: Unfortunately, the included lid doesn’t close so be sure not to let it tip over. It’s a ceramic mug, which means that it’s made of almost the exact same material as the mugs you have at home.</p>

<p>But of the containers we tried, the contigo was the most budget friendly, coming in under $15 for a mug that will easily keep your coffee hot enough to drink for a commute to the office. The best thermal mugs have been designed to hold in the heat for up to six hours, and some can keep your coffee hot and steamy for the best part of a day! Unfortunately, the included lid doesn’t close so be sure not to let it tip over. It’s a ceramic mug, which means that it’s made of almost the exact same material as the mugs you have at home. There isn’t a ton of information on how long standard ceramic mugs keep a drink hot, but in my own experience, coffee temperature drops. Whatever the temperature, the drink can be kept hot or cold for several hours.</p>
