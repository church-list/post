<p><strong>How To Make Good Coffee At Home</strong>. And of course you can�t drink iced coffee without a cute reusable straw ($10, amazon). The chemex is a popular (and pretty!) choice for brewing pour over coffee at home, using the infusion method.

Using flavor shots or a flavored creamer can make coffee taste even better. If you drink coffee every day, give your machine frequent deep cleanings.</p>

<p>Leave room for cream and sugar if you take it that way. Both nutmeg and cinnamon enhance the flavor of coffee, and agave nectar can be used in place of sugar as a sweetener.
