<p>Be sure the coffee is still and not swirling when you pour the cream on top. The whipped cream should be thick and airy, but still pourable. Add the whisky to the coffee and stir. 2) add irish whiskey to a mug. Nirvana can be found at the bottom of your first irish coffee. Do a practice one in case you make a mistake pouring on the cream.</p>

<p>Use freshly brewed coffee for the best flavor. Let hot water sit in the mug, then dump it out. While the alcohol effect may be minimal, drinking irish coffee will keep some people awake. Heat a tall, sturdy glass (traditionally with a stem) with boiling water. If you don�t usually drink caffeine at night, use decaffeinated coffee. Pour over hot coffee and stir to dissolve sugar, then pour in whiskey.</p>
