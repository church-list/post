The ovalware airtight cold brew iced coffee maker holds up to 4 cups of coffee, and thanks to its airtight seal, it will keep your java fresh for up to two weeks! A good latte or cappuccino is like a rich milky mug of heaven. If your coffee cup measures 3.5oz, you will have coffee within 1 minute.</p>

This coffee maker uses an ancient moka brewing process that heats coffee grounds against a low heat for more extended periods, which provides a rich, bold taste.</p>
