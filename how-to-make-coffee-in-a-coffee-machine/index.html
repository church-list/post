<p>And that comes pretty close to the taste of regular coffee. When you make a pot of coffee, the first thing you do is fill the reservoir with filtered water. Insert the coffee filter and fill with medium fine ground coffee. Adding a drop of vanilla essence to every 500ml of coffee made will give it a lovely sweet flavour. If you’re just making a cup for yourself, keep it standard and go for 12 ounces, filling the measuring cup to about 13 ounces to account for evaporation and coffee absorption. A drip coffee machine is one of the easiest ways to make coffee because you can usually make it in advance and it will stay warm.</p>
