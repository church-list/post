<p><strong>Coffee Grounds Down Sink Good Or Bad</strong>. Think about how much coffee nordstrom’s serve customers in a hour, day, week, or months. After each coffee or expresso was brewed they would dump the grounds in the sink. Coffee grounds don�t hurt the garbage disposal. If you put them down the sink, you might want to set aside a couple of bucks every time, so you have money to pay the plumber to clear the drains when the time comes.</p>

<p>“and smelling fresh!” not true. This will keep liquid out of your trash and coffee grounds out of your sink. However, these don’t seem to be the case. This is why most instant coffee is extremely fine and dissolves into a good cup of coffee (what constitutes a good cup of coffee is subjective and not relevant to drain or sink clogs). Other major causes of a clogged drain are oil, fat, and other food particles. “it keeps them clear,” they would say, as they dumped their morning grounds down their delicate plumbing system.</p>

<p>I got tired of calling magnolia plumbing and set the rule all coffee grounds had to be dumped in a separate trash can. “it keeps them clear,” they would say, as they dumped their morning grounds down their delicate plumbing system. Since they’re abrasive and acidic, coffee grounds are good at scrubbing away residue on pots and pans. Coffee grounds must be disposed of in the trash or composted. Otherwise, coffee grounds should just be thrown out with the garbage. Back in the day, people thought coffee grounds were good for their pipes.</p>
