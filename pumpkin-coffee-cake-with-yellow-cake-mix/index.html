<p>You can add chopped up apples to the crumb topping to make it an apple cinnamon coffee. It is so easy to do and i almost always have all the ingredients on hand. And since it’s a coffee cake, of course it’s all topped off with a classic, crumbly streusel topping. Mix together pumpkin, eggs, sugar, evaporated milk, and cinnamon. This pumpkin coffee cake with cake mix originally calls for a spice cake mix. In a large bowl, combine the first 6 ingredients;</p>
