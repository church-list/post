<p>Lion coffee is owned by hawaii coffee company, the largest roaster and distributor of gourmet coffee in hawaii. One of those lion programs made it possible for me to live in the dorms bill free and that saved a large amount of money. We take the beans from tree to roast and guarantee a cup of coffee you will love. The rich volcanic soil drains well and is packed with minerals. Lion coffee is one of america’s oldest major coffee companies. My youtube to page still has a video of our first resident’s amazing long winding tropical driveway with lots of coffee trees.</p>
