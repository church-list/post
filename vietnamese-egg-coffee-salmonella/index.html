<p><strong>Vietnamese Egg Coffee Salmonella</strong>. You’ve heard, perhaps, of raw eggs in cocktails (ramos gin fizz, eggnog), but in soda?! You can certainly control the strength of the coffee/espresso in your egg coffee, but i recommend sticking to a fairly strong brew. When some people see “raw eggs” in recipes such as mayonnaise, vietnamese egg coffee, caesar salad, and so on, they walk away and i don’t blame them. Vietnamese coffee has always been a favorite.</p>

<p>There can be a small chance that raw eggs can carry the salmonella bacterium but there’s a process that can be done to kill this harmful bacteria which is pasteurizing eggs. When some people see “raw eggs” in recipes such as mayonnaise, vietnamese egg coffee, caesar salad, and so on, they walk away and i don’t blame them. Brew 1 cup of coffee. The spout of the pot can be stuffed with soft paper towel to prevent escape of the fragrant aroma. While the water is boiling, crack the egg (with the shell) into a cup and stir. 1½ cups (330g) caster sugar.</p>

<p>Soda sữa hột gà, or vietnamese egg soda, may seem odd, but it’s surprisingly refreshing. This new vietnamese coffee brand has refreshed my daily caffeine ritual.
