<p><strong>Sugar Substitute For Dalgona Coffee</strong>. It’s usually made with instant coffee and sugar, but it works just as fine with any granulated low carb sugar substitute such as erythritol or monk fruit. Of course, this amount of sugar is totally fine as a treat, but i wanted to see if it was possible to reduce the sugar and still have the whipped coffee turn out. I used an herbal coffee substitute called the dandy blend (not sponsored). To do so, put an equal amount of instant coffee powder or your instant coffee substitute, sugar, and hot water in a bowl.</p>

<p>To do so, put an equal amount of instant coffee powder or your instant coffee substitute, sugar, and hot water in a bowl. Usually, you�d add 2 tbsps of each. Dalgona coffee, also known as whipped coffee has crazily taken off like wild fire on social media platforms (such as tik tok and ig), and rightfully so. Add ice and top with fluffy coffee foam. Just mix an equal amount of water, sweetener and instant coffee, whip it and make this creamy delight that you can pour over any milk of your choice, hot or cold. I was wondering if there are any possibilities that we could have similar results if we do not use sugar?</p>

<p>For sugar free whipped coffee, just swap in a granulated sugar substitute that has a cup for cup equivalent measure as regular sugar. So, typically this coffee is made with equal parts of hot water, instant coffee, and sugar. My version of this sugar free dalgona coffee has been adapted to fit the keto and low carb lifestyle. Pour the froth over brewed coffee. Whisk the instant coffee, sugar, and hot water together until the mixture turns into a frothy golden brown. For people with low blood pressure adding sugar to coffee can do wonders.</p>
