<p><strong>Healthier Coffee Creamer Alternatives</strong>. 7 grams of sugar may sound intimidating, but that is for 1 cup of coconut milk. Be aware of how many times you add it to your coffee because it can add up quickly. The egg itself adds a bit of protein, making the norwegian egg coffee a much healthier alternative to the typical coffee creamer. It’s made of half coconut cream and half almond milk.</p>

<p>Looking for a healthy coffee creamer that still gives you the creaminess of real milk? Luckily, there are healthier alternatives to coffee creamers that taste good and are much better for you. With similar health benefits to coconut oil, coconut milk will also satisfy your creamy milk cravings. Healthy coffee creamers typically avoid ingredients like corn syrup and are low in saturated fat. Good news for all of you poor dairy intolerant souls. By adding honey you will make your drink super healthy as it will act as an excellent natural alternative to coffee creamer and sugar.</p>

<p>Lactose &amp; casein free coffee creamer is also very healthy coffee creamer which is perfect for those who prefer milky alternatives and want cream in their coffee. Coconut milk is an excellent alternative to the creamer as it only has 7 grams of sugar in one cup compared to 15ml of coffee mate’s coffee creamer, which has 5g of sugar and 1.5g of fat. Coffee mate’s original flavor is a classic creamer that’s been in grocery aisles for ages. To skip the sugar entirely, choose cinnamon (the best sweetener for coffee in our book!) or unsweetened cacao powder, both of which have zero sugar and come with health benefits. This unflavored creamer was our testers’ favorite of the bunch. It uses coconut milk, water, cocoa powder, almond extract, and medjool dates, which add to the flavor.</p>
