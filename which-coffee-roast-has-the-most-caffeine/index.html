<p><strong>Which Coffee Roast Has The Most Caffeine</strong>. When you shop the coffee aisles, more than likely you’ll see light roast, medium roast, or dark roast. With two main varieties accounting for the majority of the world’s coffee production, you’ll usually be left with a choice between robusta coffee or arabica coffee. The typical robusta bean has nearly twice as much caffeine as arabica (and some have nearly four times as much). In fact, it’s sort of become an unofficial caffeine race in some circles where roasters will try to put together the most caffeinated cup of coffee possible.</p>

<p>Caffeine in coffee, delicious coffee… a common question i’m asked is, “what has more caffeine, light roast or dark roast?” there’s a lot of falsehood out there about caffeine and coffee. An average morning cup of robusta coffee (about 12 oz.) could contain anywhere between 232 to 800 milligrams. But these beans are also characterized by caffeine content. In fact, it’s sort of become an unofficial caffeine race in some circles where roasters will try to put together the most caffeinated cup of coffee possible. These flavors have a crisp acidity to them with vibrant flavors and a mellow body. Time to explode another myth next… both light roasted and dark roasted coffee have the same amount of caffeine.</p>
<h3 id="two-coffee-varieties-grown-in-different-environments-are-likely-to-taste-different-even-when-roasted-to-the-same-level-so-it-is-important-to-try-a-variety-of-coffee-to-find-what-best-suits-your-taste">Two coffee varieties grown in different environments are likely to taste different even when roasted to the same level, so it is important to try a variety of coffee to find what best suits your taste.</h3>
<p>Without a single modification, a pike place venti hot contains 410 mg of caffeine and 310 mg for a grande. Research has found that coffee extracted from robusta beans typically contains twice the amount of caffeine compared to arabica. Regardless of roast level, all roasts will differ in taste. What should also be noted is that arabica beans vary in levels of caffeine depending on the plant species. Robusta is harsher and cheaper. Robusta has the highest caffeine concentration of 180 mg per average 8 oz (250 ml) brewed cup of coffee.</p>
