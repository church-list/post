<p>We believe an intimate knowledge of coffee farming as well as healthy, direct relationships with coffee communities make the highest quality beans. Camp coffee, french press, percolator: These coffee pods are similar to the commercial keurig cups, and they are designed to work in keurig machines. Volcanic rich soil packed with nutritious minerals, plus the natural leaf litter from the naturally occurring bird friendly shade trees, makes our 100% organic shadegrown coffee the preferred coffee of many coffee drinkers, all while conserving the rainforest. Rainforest trust is a nonprofit conservation organization focused on saving rainforests and endangered species in partnership with local. We ensure ethical and sustainable practices in all of the coffee bean farms we work with and aim to bring you rainforest blend coffee beans that are freshly roasted with high standards of excellence.</p>
