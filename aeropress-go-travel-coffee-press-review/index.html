<p><strong>Aeropress Go Travel Coffee Press Review</strong>. It brews smooth, rich coffee without the bitterness and high acidity you can expect from french press brewed coffee. Announced last year the upcoming launch of an even more portable version of the coffee maker, dubbed the aeropress go, the news was met with some degree of scepticism.the original aeropress is already well adapted for travel, so was a slightly smaller version — even one that cleverly packed all of the essential brewing accessories inside a tumbler for brewing and drinking. However, if you already have an aeropress, you may wish to hold off, as there is no major difference between the two models except for size. Thoughtfully engineered to provide all the delicious brewing capabilities of the original, the aeropress go travel coffee press includes a convenient drinking mug that doubles as a carrying case.</p>

<p>Announced last year the upcoming launch of an even more portable version of the coffee maker, dubbed the aeropress go, the news was met with some degree of scepticism.the original aeropress is already well adapted for travel, so was a slightly smaller version — even one that cleverly packed all of the essential brewing accessories inside a tumbler for brewing and drinking. The aeropress go is very similar to the original aeropress but smaller. The filter case it comes with doesn�t hold much, i was able to get 20 filters in there. Features a mug and lid that double as a traveling case. Smaller, lighter, sleeker, with an embedded cup and as performing as the bigger model, the aeropress go is perfect for traveling and maybe a great model to buy for those new to the aeropress brewing. It gives coffee lovers everything they need to conveniently brew superb coffee anywhere they want.</p>
