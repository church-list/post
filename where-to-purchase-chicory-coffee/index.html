<p>I watched it brew, and it looks dark , just like regular coffee. Chicory is a beautiful purple flower that grows in empty lots and beside the road in north america. Ground chicory is famously blended with coffee in new orleans. Never being dried out after extraction. If you want to skip the whole “grow your own” part and leap straight into the coffee part, it is possible to purchase organic roasted chicory root granules to either make into coffee on their own or to use with regular coffee as a way to add that new orleans. We use organic chicory roots only.</p>
<h3 id="chicory-can-also-be-blended-in-with-regular-coffee-as-a-flavor-complement-if-you-brew-23-grounded-coffee-and-13-chicory-coffee">Chicory can also be blended in with regular coffee as a flavor complement if you brew 2/3 grounded coffee and 1/3 chicory coffee.</h3>
<p>Use it carefully, as it�s much more soluble than coffee and can easily overpower a good quality bean at a reasonable roast level. Chicory coffee can be brewed just like regular coffee, so you can follow your guidelines and add your own spices. The perfect coffee for those who love the rich, bold flavor preferred by people in new orleans. Chicory is a traditional southern ingredient that can be added to coffee for a bolder, more intense flavor. You can find small quantities at coffee project for $4/lb. Good to the very last drop.</p>
