<p>There are no other special steps to take besides brewing the coffee ahead of when you’d like to drink it. Now you are an iced coffee expert! Having a glass of this homemade iced coffee is the best way to start your day. Fill a tall glass or a travel tumbler to the rim with ice. However, if you have a deep passion on the concentrated coffee, you do not need to add anything. To keep that rich coffee taste, you should brew your iced coffee with twice the amount of coffee grinds you use for hot coffee.</p>

<p>Bloom the coffee with 100g of 208° water. However, they’re actually very different! The ratio nathanael likes to use at home is 1 part coffee to 16 parts water, or in this case, 50 grams of coffee to 800 grams of water. Pour into a blender with the milk along with 2 or 3 handfuls of ice and maple syrup, if using, then blend until smooth and foamy. For a dairy free option we favour oat milk. I love to grind up my fair trade coffee.</p>
