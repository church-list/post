<p><strong>No Coffee Grounds In Sink Sign</strong>. I suspect in the office there is not enough water flowing through the sink on a regular basis (we never did washing up etc). Throwing your coffee grounds down the sink is one of the biggest problems that plumbers encounter and it must be avoided. They can easily collect and cause a clog in your drain. The images in the coffee are always fuzzy and imprecise, and so it is up to you to interpret them with your heart and intuition.</p>

<p>Coffee grounds to remove odors @savvycleaner by angela brown baking soda and coffee grounds are both used to neutralize odors. So it�s a definite no for the waste disposal. Coffee grounds can�t really be digested by the pipeworks. We use a press pot to make coffee at home, and usually after a 3 minute steep, the grounds are floating at the top, but with this one bag of beans we got, they�re all sunk to the bottom. It’s a good idea to know how your kitchen sink can get clogged. Posted by true at 6:50 pm on september 11, 2007</p>
