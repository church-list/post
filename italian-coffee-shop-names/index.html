<p>In rome, as with much of the bel paese, the drink of choice is usually un caffè, an espresso, or, if it’s before midday, maybe a cappuccino. When you order un caffè in italian, you will automatically be served an espresso. The entertainment factor is always a crowd puller. If you prefer your coffee a bit less strong, you will have to order a caffè americano (american coffee), an espresso to which hot water has been added, resulting in a drink that will still be stronger. Before finalizing your coffee shop name, make sure to check the availability. Nancy on march 20, 2019:</p>
