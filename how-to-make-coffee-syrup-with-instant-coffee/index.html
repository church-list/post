<p>All you need to do is make the sparkling water with your sodastream and then add the coffee syrup with sugar and citrus flavor. You can also use flavoured coffee too. Heat the water in the microwave for 30 seconds to 1 minute. The coffee syrup recipe variations i have here uses ingredients like maple syrup, caramel sauce, and peppermint candies because they bring ingredients that will keep your coffee syrup from crystallizing. Pour over the ground coffee. Coffee syrups can make great presents (alamy) it is up to you just how rich you want your syrup to be and i�d suggest anywhere between 1:1 and 2:1 ratio of water to sugar.</p>

<p>From coconut oil , to lattes, to creamers and beyond, coffee has the ability to fit into nearly every taste pallet. I try not to go crazy with these premade flavoured coffee as some of them taste very weird. Pour over the ground coffee. To make vanilla coffee syrup, stir 1 to 2 teaspoons (5 to 10 ml) of vanilla extract into the syrup as well. This coffee syrup is so simple to make and very versatile. Skim the top of the syrup with a spoon, cheesecloth or towel.</p>
