<p><strong>Protein Powder In Coffee Recipe</strong>. It’s similar to bulletproof coffee, but i actually prefer the added protein. The ingredients are simple, and it has plenty of benefits.

<p>Flavored protein powder and coffee may be enough to do the trick, but if you want to channel your inner barista, here are a few combos we love: This, i got from jennifer meyering and it calls for 1 and ½ scoop of protein powder.
