<p>Exercise experts suggest drinking a cup of coffee an hour or so before a workout and seeing if the buzz helps you power through more easily and with less fatigue. That means if you generally aim for a 10 p.m. “coffee counts as a fluid,” says skolnik, but you’ll still want some additional liquid in your tank. Coffee is high in caffeine, which is a common ingredient in any fat loss or weight loss supplement. This can take anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes, with the full effects kicking in around an hour after. If you drink a cup of coffee before a workout, it will work like the slayer sword to the battle.</p>
