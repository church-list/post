<p><strong>Coffee Grounds Down Garbage Disposal</strong>. However, coffee grounds tend to stick to wet surfaces and your disposal and drains are almost always wet. The first couple times i cleaned my french press, i just rinsed it out in the sink and let all the grounds go down, but after doing some research on whether this was good for the disposal or not i found that it really can be a problem for your pipes. Ideally, nothing could happen, which often occurs with clean, new, or abs drain lines. However, they can accumulate in drains and pipes, causing clogs.</p>

<p>They also serve as a nice fertilizer for your garden if you have a green thumb. You might be surprised to find coffee grounds on this list of things you shouldn�t put down your garbage disposal. However, they can accumulate in drains and pipes, causing clogs. Can you put coffee grounds down the drain? The more coffee grounds you pour in your disposal, the worse the clog will get. There is often the question of using a disposal for eggshells and coffee grounds.</p>

<p>Coffee grounds should always go in the trash can. Coffee grounds tend to collect at the bottom of drains, forming a sedimentary sludge that will clog with additional food scraps going down the drain as well. In fact, neither of these materials is harmful to a disposal, and will pass through it without a problem. We are here to help. Simply scrape the coffee grounds into a container or straight into the garden or compost pile. At least your trashcan will smell good.</p>
