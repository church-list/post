<p>Every sip from a steaming cup of freshly brewed kona whisks you away on an exotic hawaiian trip.

The uniquely intense flavor nuances of this coffee are a real treat in the light to medium roast range!; The papua new guinea peaberry jikawa/western highlands fresh comprises 100% arabic coffee beans.</p>

<p>Peaberry kona coffee beans have always been greatly appreciated by gourmet lovers and considered as the rarest and most exclusive type of kona. Brazilian coffee beans are nutty, low in acidity and offer a sweet taste that bursts with chocolate tastes. Peaberry kona coffee beans have always been greatly appreciated by gourmet lovers and considered as the rarest and most exclusive type of kona. Normally the fruit (cherry) of the coffee plant contains two seeds (beans) that develop with flattened facing sides, but sometimes only one of the two seeds is fertilized, and the single seed develops with nothing to flatten it. These beans are rarer and roast better than normal coffee beans. Sweet fragrance with hints of lemon.</p>
