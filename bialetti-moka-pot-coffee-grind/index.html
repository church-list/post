<p>How to make great coffee with your moka pot the bialetti moka express lives in nine out of ten italian homes, the museum of modern art and the guinness book of records. We�re talking about creating the best coffee every time. Like other brewing methods, a consistent uniform coffee grind is essential if you want great flavor and aroma from your moka pot. Make sure to tightly screw on the upper part of the pot to the lower part. But whilst this little pot’s popularity cannot be denied, brewing a great tasting cup of coffee in it can be a real challenge. The coffee that is generated actually has an extraction ratio that is higher than what you get with a new espresso machine.</p>

<p>The moka pot (sometimes referred to as a stovetop espresso maker) is a classic brewing method with strong italian roots. Add the heated water and fill to the line in the bottom of the brewer. This new, art deco coffee maker was adopted very quickly all over italy. Legend has it that the inspiration for moka pots came from watching how a primitive washing machine works… i kid you not… since the 1950’s, bialetti (the company that first patented the design) has sold over two hundred million moka pots. And since the brewing time and temperature on a moka pot are quite consistent (the maximum volume of water is dictated by the size of your pot), then your only recourse is to change your grind size. What level of grind is ideal?</p>
