<p>While this doesn�t allow you to adjust the ratio to your taste, it may be a convenient way to get the flavor of arabic coffee. The lebanese dialect is characterized by the absence or softening of certain gutteral sounds. Sugar and milk is not added to the arabic coffee; It is mostly served with dates and the way to drink the coffee is to keep a piece of the date in your mouth as you sip the coffee so the sweet taste of the date balances the strong taste of the coffee. I truly need an amazing cup of coffee every day. If a guest does not want any more coffee, he/she must jiggle the coffee cup towards the side.</p>
