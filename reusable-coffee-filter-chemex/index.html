<p><strong>Reusable Coffee Filter Chemex</strong>. Honestly though, my favorite part of the chemex is the paper filters. The coffee i’ve made using the cloth chemex filters from coffeesock have been more similar to a v60 than to a traditional chemex brew. They are easy to clean and filter the coffee grounds exceptionally well. A reusable metal filter can last for up to seven years or more and cost between $5 and $60.</p>
