<p>To make whipped coffee without instant coffee, you can pour a scoop of coffee beans into a coffee grinder or blender. This is the whipped coffee drink that�s all over tiktok and instagram. The instant coffee, sugar, and water are first whipped up to create an irresistible, sweet frothy, yet thick foam. Instant coffee, sugar, water, and milk. Scoop the whipped coffee over the milk. It turns out that instant coffee has a preservative in it called xanthan gum that helps stabilize the coffee when whipped—giving it that airy, frothy texture.</p>
