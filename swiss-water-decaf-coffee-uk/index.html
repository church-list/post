<p><strong>Swiss Water Decaf Coffee Uk</strong>. Unlike popular american blends, cafe don pablo offers a medium bodied flavor with notes of citrus along with low acidity. This colombian decaf is popular for its tasting notes of sweet, rich, mild and smooth flavors. Using water, this process removes 99.9% of the caffeine without affecting the flavour, body and aroma of this unique origin. When choosing a decaf, look for these as chemical methods affect compounds key for the flavours and aromas of the magic bean to a much greater degree.</p>

<p>Our master roaster at gordon st coffee would always recommend coffee in its natural caffeinated form, however for those of you who like a wee decaf we have our central american coffee decaffeinated using the solvent free swiss water process. Free uk delivery with orders over £25. Café bustelo coffee originated in east harlem in the early 1930s. It removes 99.9% of the caffeine without using chemicals. Having tried decaf beans from a number of roasters we then found swiss water decaf from the house of coffee and have never changed. Then we add local water and a dash of loving attention by monitoring time and temperature until the coffee is 99.9% caffeine free.</p>
