<p>Trying a whipped coffee ☕ recipe from tiktok. I used a very dark italian roast coffee and 1% milk. Whip with a hand mixer until frothy and thick, about 5 minutes. For most instant coffees, a prescribed “cup” of coffee is one teaspoon of crystals mixed. Dalgona is a viral success on tiktok, but it’s also gaining steam on youtube. If you use a regular whisk, it will take a lot longer so i highly recommend a hand mixer.</p>
