<p><strong>Rug Under Coffee Table Or Not</strong>. The only thing you need to try and do is make sure that the legs of your chairs and dining table are not the same color as the rug itself or there will be little to distinguish between them! Definitely a round rug in a medium neutral tone under your dining table. The same goes for a square table on a rectangular rug. Take your coffee table, for example.</p>

<p>Definitely a round rug in a medium neutral tone under your dining table. This table is too low to use club chairs around it and besides, i have a round glass and iron breakfast table that will be in the breakfast. If that’s not possible, it might be better to center under the coffee table instead so that you have enough room for your other pieces to fit well around it. Benches like that don�t actually get moved that much. They�re not everyone�s choice, but they�re generally left in one spot and people shuffle in and out. The rug is not meant to be used with this set but it has to be used right now.</p>
