<p>Now that we’ve talked about the top coffee bean growing regions and some of the characteristics of each, we reveal our findings for the best ethiopian coffee brands from each region.

<h3 id="yirgacheffe-coffee-beans-are-considered-to-be-some-of-the-best-in-the-world-by-coffee-connoisseurs">Yirgacheffe coffee beans are considered to be some of the best in the world by coffee connoisseurs.</h3>
<p>Each of these states has several coffee regions, but the most famous ones are djima, yirgacheffe, sidamo, harrar, &amp; limu. While the best ethiopian coffee available today is subjective to a large extent, coffee brands from the yirgacheffe region (this is included in sidamo), almost always find their way onto lists of people’s favorites. One popular brand of harrar coffee is koffee kult’s ethiopian harrar coffee, a medium roast with a balanced/full body and smooth hints of dark chocolate and blueberry. This is not surprising, because arabica beans were discovered here. Notably, ethiopian coffee tastes slightly different, depending on the region where it’s grown, and the growing conditions. Volcanica’s ethiopian yirgacheffe is a testament to the extremely large standing of the area.</p>
