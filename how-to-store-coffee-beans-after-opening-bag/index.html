<p><strong>How To Store Coffee Beans After Opening Bag</strong>. Make sure you store your beans in a tupperware container or a zip lock bag. (alternatively, you can pour the ground coffee out of its original packaging directly into a foodsaver bag.) in either case, vacuum seal the bag, and then store it in the freezer. It’s to let co2 out (lest the bag puff up like a balloon) and to block oxygen from entering the bag. Coffee beans can be beautiful, but avoid clear canisters which will allow light to compromise the taste of coffee.</p>

<p>This isn’t the ideal solution for coffee because there will still be oxygen in the container. Vacuum seal it, leaving about an inch at the end of the bag to allow for opening and resealing of the bag. Only open it once you�ve run out of fresh coffee and allow it to completely thaw before opening the vacuum sealed bag. Keep your beans in a dark and cool location. Make sure you store your beans in a tupperware container or a zip lock bag. This release of gas is very important for coffee roasters &amp; packers to understand.</p>
