<p>It came with the day tripper blend from good folks coffee and the honduras marcala flor raos azul organic (try saying that 3 times fast) from anodyne coffee roasting. Behind the scenes, they work hard to discover new coffees, develop relationships, and deliver the coffee you deserve. The day tripper blend was pretty good, though i�m still learning how to get a good cup out of the aeropress i bought for the occasion. The liqueur is infused with roasted coffee beans from good folks coffee co., the wholesale coffee roaster in the shelby park neighborhood of louisville. Coffees from colombia and peru were carefully chosen and blended together. My first cup was very juicy.</p>
