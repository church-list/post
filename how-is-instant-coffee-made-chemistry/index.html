<p><strong>How Is Instant Coffee Made Chemistry</strong>. But, if you�re a fan of instant coffee, no need to worry as the freeze or spray drying process to make the instant stuff doesn’t destroy the useful acids. The process is similar to using a coffee percolator at home. Fill the kettle with fresh tap water, each and every time. It might be said that coffee aroma is the most important attribute to specialty coffee.</p>

<p>In this issue of coffee science we’ll briefly discuss a family of compounds called ‘alkaloids’ which serve an important role in coffee’s unique chemical composition. Instant coffee is a type of coffee made from dried coffee extract. Similarly to how regular coffee is brewed, the extract is made by brewing ground coffee beans, although it’s more concentrated. Espresso powder—or instant espresso—is very similar to instant coffee, but it�s stronger and is often made from a better quality coffee. Although caffeine is the most well know molecule and although is a bitter compound, it only contributes about 15% of coffee�s bitter compounds. The steam above a freshly made cup of instant coffee is really water vapor droplets condensing after evaporating from the hot coffee.</p>
