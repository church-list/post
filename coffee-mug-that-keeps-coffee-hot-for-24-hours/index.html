<p><strong>Coffee Mug That Keeps Coffee Hot For 24 Hours</strong>. It’s made from stainless steel and can keep your coffee hot for 12 hours and cold for 24 hours. S’well bottles are for more than just the gym. Use either a travel mug that has stainless steel inside. This mug is lightweight, but keeps my coffee hot, not warm, for a long time (one and a half to two hours).</p>

<p>What i also like about this thermos beverage carafe is that it comes in a variety of smaller sizes which can be handy for some people. For quality, convenience and also results, the stanley large coffee thermos is hard to beat. Ember is a clever travel mug that cools your coffee to your desired temperature and keeps it there for hours. Right now my coffee is at 135 deg after 1.5 hours and they appears to be about 10 oz from 16 left. This is because you will be able to maintain the ideal temperature for at least 24 hours. For many people, beginning the day without a hot cup of coffee or tea just doesn’t feel right.</p>
