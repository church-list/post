Nitrogen gas also adds a little bit of sweetness to the drink. Nestlé is this month, march 2018, launching a brand new product for coffee fans in the uk and ireland.

<p>Nitrogen is a coffee game changer. Nitro cold brew coffee is a whole new world. But the main reason you should start your day with the cup of nitro joe lies in the new world of flavor. The nitrogen gas blends with coffee to make nitro coffee. That’s why it works so well for coffee. Yes, nitrogen gas infused in coffee is safe to drink, nitrogen makes up 70 percent of the air you are currently breathing.</p>

<p>Regular and organic coffee antioxidants provide much of flavor as well as the health benefits of drinking coffee. Imagine the fineness of a good, cold pint of dark stout with rich foam on the top. In addition to improving the texture and mouthfeel of your cup of coffee, the nitrogen used in nitro coffee also adds a hint of sweetness. Nitrogen provides another benefit, again because of its inertness. Kegs are used to keep the beer nice and frothy, which is exactly what people have started doing to coffee. To get nitrogen into the liquid, the tap squeezes the drink through tiny holes, giving the beverage a particularly smooth and frothy head.</p>
