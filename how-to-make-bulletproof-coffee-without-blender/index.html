<p><strong>How To Make Bulletproof Coffee Without Blender</strong>. Adding a boost of nutrition to your morning joe to jump start your metabolism, boost your immune system, calm your nerves (and more!) adds even more validity to your daily habit. Being able to use a coffee mill correctly is important so that you get the correct kind of coffee grind for the type of coffee brewing method you choose to make your daily cup(s) of bulletproof® coffee. I’ve been making this stuff for years, and there are definitely some cons to using a traditional blender, so i found an easier way! Whether it’s because of someone at the gym who swears by the physical energy boost, a friend who has recently been giving tips on fasting, a coworker who is suddenly more productive in the morning, or just a casual search for new coffee recipes, there’s way more than meets.</p>
