<p>This gal subjected every camping coffee maker to rigorous testing in and out of the backcountry, with craft coffee from all over colorado and utah. You’ll need to boil the water first and then pour it into the espresso maker. The dripper seems to fit every average coffee cup you own, and add a filter to it, put in the ground coffee, and slowly pour the water over the surface of the dripper, to allow a slow but even drip into your cup. It is about the size of a water bottle, has folding handles and a nesting cup, making it compact and easy to pack.

The portable coffee maker’s pressurized system and quick process mean that you won’t get that highly acidic and bitter taste that comes with long steep times.</p>
