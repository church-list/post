<p><strong>Less Acidic Coffee Roast</strong>. The strange thing is, coffee does often get branded as acidic, but in reality, a cup of coffee is only around five on the ph scale , which makes coffee less acidic than say a can of soda, a beer, or a glass of orange juice. Acidity is one of the key attributes that make up a cup of specialty coffee. Non acidic coffee beans help to maintain a consistent flavor without the bitterness. Black coffee generally lands around a ph of 4.5 (acidic, not basic) and milk has a ph of 6.5 (slightly more neutral).</p>

<p>Compared to lighter roasts such as the cinnamon roast or blonde roast, which have high acidity levels, french roasts are significantly less acidic and have a more roasted coffee flavor. Medium or light roasts will have more acid in them. Sodas get their acidity from the dissolved carbon dioxide. If you prefer a more acidic, more subtle coffee that retains the character of the coffee beans, you’re better off going with medium roast. It is less acidic than most sodas, and juices. Does light roast coffee have less acid?</p>

<p>For those who prefer less acidic coffee you will want to go with a dark roast as the longer coffee beans are roasted the lower the acid level will be. Dark roast coffee also causes less acid to be secreted by the stomach than light or medium roasts. They offer up to a 70% reduction in acid compared to other brands. The arabica species, for example, tends to have less. It’s the acidity that causes that brightness. Since dark roast blends of coffee have less acid than lighter roasts, try their dark french roast.if you don’t like dark blends, the puroast house blend is also a great choice that is low in acid content.</p>
