<p><strong>Bourbon Whiskey In Coffee</strong>. It’s sweet and just a little bit spicy, with prominent notes of vanilla and fruit. The bitterness and coca flavors of coffee pair perfectly with bourbon’s sweetness and smokiness. This made the perfect christmas gift for my boyfriend, who loves both coffee and bourbon, and he was very impressed at how present and tasty the bourbon flavor. If you want your cup of joe to really have a kick, consider adding some bourbon.</p>
