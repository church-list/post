<p>A key part of the pour over method is using a filter to trap solids. Failing that, you can use some kitchen towel. You can either fold the towel and place it in the filter space hoping the grinds won’t find their way through, or you can fold it to mimic a #2 cone coffee filter like in this youtube video: The double layer filter keeps most coffee grounds out of your cup, while releasing flavorful oils. But, if you are seeking cost, maintenance and durability, permanent filters is the best choice. At the moment, all cannabis enthusiasts filter the oil either through a fine cheesecloth or a paper coffee filter.</p>

It allows the coffee to travel through it at more of a precise rate than paper towel, which is normally thinner. They fit perfectly inside the coffee maker. I�m only 17 so i can�t buy papers yet, and i don�t see my supplier often.
