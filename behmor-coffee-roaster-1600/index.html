<p>I sit here watching yet another batch of coffee ruined by my upgraded behmor 1600 panel. The behmor 1600 plus is a great way to get into home coffee roasting, without the high price tag of other home roasters.

You can manually adjust the roasts, but i suggest you not to do it right away. Take the drum out, and start roaster on manual full power (p5) (always 1lb). The behmor 1600 plus drum roaster also features five customizable roast profile settings, efficient cooling and chaff removal and removable chaff tray and drum for easy cleaning of the interior.</p>
