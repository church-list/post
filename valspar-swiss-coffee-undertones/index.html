<p>After trying samples of swiss coffee, white dove, simply white, and linen white in multiple different areas on the house and viewing them at different times of the day i went with benjamin moore white dove. The behr sample was a bright(!!!) blue with a touch of green and maybe gray undertones. Swiss coffee by valspar works well with warm neutrals or shades of mint and teal. Swiss coffee (12) by behr.
