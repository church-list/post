<p>The company�s decaf blend is a dark roast that customers generally describe as rich, robust, and flavorful. Decaf coffee is coffee that goes through an extraction process that removes most of the caffeine. While all kinds of coffee are somewhat acidic, the exact ph level of a coffee depends on the kind of bean, roast, and brewing method used. But decaf coffee has higher loss of chlorogenic acids because of the chemical changes that it underwent during the decaf coffee process. You�ll find notes of roasted hazelnuts and milk chocolate in every sip. If acidic coffee bothers you, try a sumatran, brazilian or indonesian coffee.</p>

<p>Even if you love coffee, you may need to switch to low acid coffee or possibly decaf to reduce gastrointestinal problems. Low acid decaf coffee has only 8 to 14 mg of caffeine, whereas, normal brewed coffee has about 70 mg of caffeine. This means fewer stomach problems and more enjoyment from your coffee every day. Every coffee lover wants decaf to taste like the real thing, and kicking horse coffee is up to the challenge. Decaf coffee has been shown to cause significantly less acid reflux than regular coffee (29, 30). On average, black coffee has a ph of about 5, which is the same as carrots.</p>
