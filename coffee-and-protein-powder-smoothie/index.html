<p>To make this smoothie vegan, use a plant based milk and protein powder. The oatmeal in many of them provides healthy, complex carbs and great texture. I opt for more natural sweeteners like real maple syrup or coconut sugar in my coffee smoothie, since they also have trace amounts of beneficial nutrients. That means if you click on my link and buy something, i will earn a small commission from the advertiser at no additional cost to you. For a stronger chocolate coffee smoothie taste, add chocolate protein powder in place of the peanut protein powder. Since this coffee protein shake contains plenty of protein and healthy fat, the carbs don’t adversely affect my blood sugar.</p>
