<p><strong>Remove Coffee Stain From Wool Carpet</strong>. To prevent the liquid from becoming a part of your rug forever, follow these easy steps for a diy coffee remover. I’ve tried every way and it’s lifted the stain a bit but not completely. The bad news is, more often than not these coffee or tea stains can be impossible to remove in wool carpets due to the tannin present in the liquid actually having dyed or permanently changed the colour of the carpet. Blot the stain with a dry towel to remove the stain from the carpet fibers.</p>

<p>How to remove coffee stains from wool. If the stain has dried, then make a mix of 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda with 1 cup tepid water. Remove all loose shoe polish by scraping the stained area first with a blunt knife or spoon. Spilling coffee on your wool carpeting can put you in a bad mood but you should take a deep breath and read on. Alternatively, you can combine 1 tablespoon of dish soap, 1 tablespoon of white vinegar, and 2 cups of warm water. You have the best chance of completely eliminating the stain if you move fast.</p>

<p>Despite the dark, ugly stain it leaves behind, coffee is relatively simple to remove, especially if you clean it as soon as it spills. Ideally, immediately rinse under cold running water to dilute the coffee. Remember not to rub the stain, but use a firm scraping motion to lift the top layers of shoe polish off the carpet. I accidentally dropped a mug of coffee on a carpet 100% wool. If the stain has dried, then make a mix of 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda with 1 cup tepid water. However, there are a lot of stains that are very resistant to simply water and a soapy cleaning solution.</p>
