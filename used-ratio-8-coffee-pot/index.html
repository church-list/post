<p>Drip coffee pot, pour over, french press coffee, percolator, and espresso brewed coffee. Then, fill the water chamber with equal parts white vinegar and water, and run a brew cycle. Water is quickly heated to the correct temperature and then gently distributed over fresh ground coffee for a delicious cup of coffee. The grind and amount of coffee used for a percolator differs from drip or french press coffee makers. The ratio takes care of “blooming” your coffee, meaning it extracts co2 to minimize bitterness, and there is even a carafe you can buy to make sure coffee stays warm. As for measuring 0.36 oz of coffee, there are a couple of ways to do that.</p>

In general, a 1:1 ratio is typically considered a ristretto shot.</p>
