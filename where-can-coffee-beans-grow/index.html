<p><strong>Where Can Coffee Beans Grow</strong>. If you drink coffee (and probably even if you don’t), you’ve seen the fruit of the coffee plant. The best option to grow coffee plants is to use fresh, green coffee arabica beans. The ideal temperature range is from 59 to 75 degrees fahrenheit, but coffee trees can survive brief periods of freezing weather. But they adapt easily to life in a pot, and can grow into a full and productive bush.</p>

<p>Other areas in hawaii where coffee is grown on a large scale include kaʻū, puna, and hāmākua. Once you have your coffee bean, soak it for 24 hours to soften. If you live in a colder climate, you can still grow your own coffee tree, just indoors. You can grow coffee from seed, but i recommend buying a plant from your local nursery since it can take a few years before a seed grows into a plant mature enough to produce cherries the beans come from. Coffee plants only grow in tropical regions in regions between the tropics of cancer and capricorn in a region known by the coffee elite as the bean belt. So that means the average coffee drinker uses 25.95 pounds of roasted coffee beans per year.</p>
