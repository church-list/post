<p><strong>Nitrogen Infused Coffee Bad For You</strong>. They loved it, but they felt bad asking for it because i had to (at the time) manually grind the beans and make only one cup at a time unless i wanted to make a big huge mess. Whereas draft coffee comes straight from the tap, nitro, as brew geeks call it, is coffee infused with nitrogen. The draft latte’s frothiness lasts about 10 times longer than nitrogen infused coffee drinks. Nitro infused coffee has high caffeine content in it.</p>

The concept of infusing beverages with gas is not new at all; To get nitrogen into the liquid, the tap squeezes the drink through tiny holes, giving the beverage a particularly smooth and frothy head. Nitrogen infused coffee are less acidic compared to normal coffee and beverages mixed with carbon dioxide. It�s a totally new experience for coffee lovers, and has been gaining wild popularity in the specialty coffee industry.</p>
