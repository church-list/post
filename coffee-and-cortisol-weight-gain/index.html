<p>While this seems logical, a more holistic view evaluates coffee from the perspective of its influence on the body�s ability to metabolize the other food we eat. Cortisol, commonly referred to as the stress hormone, has an influence on your hunger, appetite, muscle gain, and where you’re likely to store fat. Coffee also regulates the degradation of cortisol at the tissues including liver, muscle and fat. As long as you avoid chronically elevated or depleted cortisol you can make the little hormone work to your advantage. In fact, despite what you may read online, there’s no solid evidence linking coffee consumption to permanent weight loss. Many people consume coffee as a way to improve energy, mental focus, alertness and wakefulness in the morning.</p>
