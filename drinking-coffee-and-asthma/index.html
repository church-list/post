<p>According to a study posted to international archives of allergy and immunology, the dust from green coffee beans causes an allergic reaction. This can cause your doctor to prescribe a lower dose or a weaker drug than what you need to manage your asthma. Coffee’s effect in treating asthma is real. Medicines for asthma tend to have an elevated dose of caffeine or its extracts (theophylline) or synthetic derivatives. Compared with subjects who did not drink coffee, the estimated relative risks were 0.95 for one cup, 0.77 for two, and 0.72 for three or more cups per day when allowance was made for age and sex only. Coffee is very similar to theophylline 3, a drug that john wrote about in the post i mentioned earlier.</p>
