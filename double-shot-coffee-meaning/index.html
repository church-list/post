<p><strong>Double Shot Coffee Meaning</strong>. This results in 60 ml of drink, double the amount of a single shot espresso.more commonly called a standard double, it is a standard in judging the espresso quality in barista competitions but only because four single espresso are made using two double portafilters. Be sure to ask the bartender which regional liquor they recommend. If you prefer a different number of shots in your drink, you can make that request. The volume of the shot is the same, but the amount of crema will differ vastly, meaning two very different tastes from two different recipes.</p>
