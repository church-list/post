<p><strong>Single Cup Pour Over Coffee Recipe</strong>. It produces a beautifully clean and nuanced cup of coffee. A filter cone, filter paper, freshly roasted coffee (15g coffee for a single cup) and a kettle of water. The secret to perfect coffee is the right ratio of coffee to water —1:16, or 1 gram of coffee for every 16 grams of water. But for a barista, this is the beginning of an experiment.</p>

<p>The pour over is a funny thing. The bloom pour saturates all of the grounds and will help later with an even extraction. If you’ve never tried a pour over before, the final cup is reminiscent of one from a drip coffee maker, but noticeably more delicate and complex. Notably, its spiraled ridges inside of the brewer promote even extraction through the entire bed of coffee, and its availability in 5 different material options (glass, ceramic, plastic, copper, and steel), 3 different sizes (01, 02 and 03, intended for approximately 350ml, 600ml, and 1l brews. This terrific coffee was brewed following “the pour over method,” and it’s not hard to duplicate at home.
