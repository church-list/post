<p><strong>Difference Between Espresso And Coffee Beans</strong>. Coffee beans meant for the espresso machine go through a longer roasting time and ground fine while those beans destined for a cup of drip coffee or brewed coffee are coarser and roasted for less amount of time. A coffee pack with an espresso label is just the manufacturer’s way of informing the consumers how to prepare that particular pack. The real difference between the two is actually how they’re roasted. Many mistake espresso as being a different bean due to the difference in texture, taste, and caffeination of the beverage, but the difference lies in the process by which an espresso is made.</p>

<p>While there are different types and blends of espresso bean, the most basic difference is between the lighter arabica and darker robusta. It has nothing to do with the beans. Espresso is a drink brewed with finely ground beans using highly pressurized water to create a small cup of concentrated coffee that has a bold and rich flavor. Espresso and drip coffee theoretically have the same concept. The main difference between coffee beans that will result in a coffee beverage and the beans that will result in an espresso beverage is the blend, the roast, the grind, and the concentration. It is in this phase that the espresso bean finally takes shape.</p>

<p>Espresso beans will be roasted for longer than beans used for drip coffee. Espresso calls for a very fine grind, while the grind for coffee normally skews to the medium and coarse end, depending on which coffee preparation method you choose of course. Coffee beans designated for espresso are generally roasted for a longer amount of time than beans meant for drip coffee. The big difference is that they are made from two different ways of preparation and the way the coffee beans are roasted and ground. While espresso is more intense and darker than ordinary coffee, this does not mean it should use blends as high in robusta beans. Espresso and drip coffee theoretically have the same concept.</p>
