<p><strong>Coffee Water Filter Reddit</strong>. Drip coffee makers disperse hot water over ground coffee. This is simple to use. If you have 1g of coffee and 1g of water, the ratio of coffee to water is 1:1. When all of the water has passed from the bottom to the top, the coffee is done.</p>

These coffee makers almost always feature a warming plate to keep the coffee warm after brewing, but the coffee they produce is never as piping hot as what you get from a percolator.</p>
