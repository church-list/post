I was drinking decaf only until my ob said that she would rather me do 1 cup of regular coffee a day then decaf do the extra chemicals used in processing decaf coffee I don�t want to give it up,but i really love my coffee. If you�re pregnant, limit the amount of caffeine you have to 200 milligrams (mg) a day. The good news about coffee in late pregnancy.</p>

<p>It seems early pregnancy caffeine may have a greater effect than caffeine during pregnancy in the second trimester or third trimester. And drinking a lot of caffeine For best practice, avoid regular coffee and try decaffeinated coffee, especially while pregnant. I quit coffee until 12 weeks then i only drink 1 cup a day. 8 ounce latte or mocha: I don�t want to give it up,but i really love my coffee.</p>
<h3 id="decaf-coffee-during-pregnancy-second-trimester-">Decaf coffee during pregnancy second trimester :</h3>
<p>1/2 cup in the am then 1/2 cup in mid morning. When you eat a couple of chocolate bars your coffee consumption goes higher than you might have planned for. High levels of caffeine in pregnancy can result in babies having a low birthweight, which can increase the risk of health problems in later life. Caffeinated coffee should be limited to no more than one to two cups of coffee per day. If you need a caffeine boost but are concerned about your intake, you might choose a latte (about 75 mg of caffeine). So i feel like i�m stretching it out and drinking 2 cups.</p>
