Passionate supporters and suppliers of fairtrade teas and coffees since the late 1990’s. From deep, dark &amp; delicious to lively and bright; Since then, the average commodity price has been $1.11—that’s 29 cents below the fair trade minimum for conventional coffee and 59 cents below the fair trade minimum for certified organic. The coffee supply chain is complex as beans pass through the hands of growers, traders, processors, exporters, roaster, retailers and finally the consumer. Most farmers have little idea of where their coffee goes or what price it ends up selling for.</p>
