<p>I found this farmhouse style cabinet here farmhouse coffee bar signs. This is what i came up with! A farmhouse style coffee bar would not be complete without a coffee bar sign. Great for decorating kitchens, living rooms, coffee tables, an office, bar or cafe. You can do it on your kitchen counters or use a whole separate table or hutch. Ok, so although i am calling it a coffee cabinet, this baby can be used for just about anything!</p>
