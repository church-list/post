<p><strong>Instant Coffee Whipped Frosting</strong>. We were a little concerned that the instant coffee granules would make the icing gritty, but it doesn�t at all. In fact, it�s what gives this coffee frosting such great flavor. You’ll also need ½ cup of ice, 8 ounces of milk, and cocoa powder. This whipped coffee has to be stored (up to 3 months) in the freezer to maintain its creamy consistency.</p>

<p>This whipped coffee has to be stored (up to 3 months) in the freezer to maintain its creamy consistency. It was ok rate this a 4: The coffee whipped cream could be used as a frosting for cakes, tarts, or even just a topping for regular black coffee. Didn�t like it rate this a 3: We paired the frosting with chocolate cupcakes and it was the perfect. We were a little concerned that the instant coffee granules would make the icing gritty, but it doesn�t at all.</p>
<h3 id="all-you-need-is-instant-coffee-sugar-and-water-at-a-111-ratio-then-just-whip-and-pour-over-milk">All you need is instant coffee, sugar, and water at a 1:1:1 ratio, then just whip and pour over milk.</h3>
<p>Perfect for when you need a frosting lighter than buttercream but still want that delicious mocha taste. Store frosting in the fridge for up to 7 days, let come to room temperature and mix before using. And, the best part is, it needs 4 ingredients and 5 minutes to prepare. I then poured some cold coconut milk in a glass and added the whipped coffee and now i’m hooked on this stuff. Nothing better than coffee topped with coffee. Mix the coffee powder with the water in a small bowl until dissolved.</p>
