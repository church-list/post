<p>The cake is done when the edges pull away from the sides of the mug. I thiink the best part of this coffee mug cake is the fact that i won’t be tempted by having a whole coffee cake sitting on the counter, calling my name. Serving suggestions include cool whip, caramel sauce, or ice cream. Pour into prepared baking dish. Mug cakes have been popular almost as long as microwaves have been around.
