<p>I had an urge for a tim horton�s iced cappuccino one day and found this recipe. Add 1/2 cup skim milk to a blender and blend for 30 seconds. The foam blended perfectly with the almond milk and offered a pillowy texture. This beautiful, ombré drink boasts a slight coffee flavor with a sweet aftertaste. This recipe is for an iced dalgona coffee. It should contain real bourbon vanilla.</p>
