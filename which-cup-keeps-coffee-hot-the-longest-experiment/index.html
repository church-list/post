<p><strong>Which Cup Keeps Coffee Hot The Longest Experiment</strong>. Place all three cups (styrofoam, plastic cup and coffee mug) on the table. Add 3 spoons of milk to the third cup. If the lid does not stay in place, chances are the lid falls off when you go to take drink and you end up burning yourself with coffee. More energy is absorbed by the coffee cup, ensuring the contents will have less energy.</p>

<p>I mean, it just does not kick in as hard as hot coffee, served fresh from the best coffee tumbler. On the first day, we filled all the containers with hot water and took the temperature of the water over the course of the day to. If the lid does not stay in place, chances are the lid falls off when you go to take drink and you end up burning yourself with coffee. I will pour hot water (the assumption being it is similar to black coffee) into three cups. My hypothesis was that the styrofoam cup would keep water warm for the longest time period. We carried out a comparative study to evaluate the insulation properties of the different materials under laboratory conditions.</p>

<p>Travel mug that keeps coffee hot the longest. While we haven’t tested the cups with hot water, i’m going to predict that the cups would cool off at the same rate and that the yeti would keep water (or a hot beverage) hot the longest. Cup 2 has no lid. First;we will prepare the paper , plastic , glass , styrofoam cup. My hypothesis was that the styrofoam cup would keep water warm for the longest time period. Half fill each cup with hot water.</p>
