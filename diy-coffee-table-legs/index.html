<p>This desk could easily convert into a coffee table just by shortening the legs and altering the height of the bottom shelf. Attaching the hairpin legs was the last step before staining. Putting this table together is super simple and literally requires only two steps: We had to use a clamp to hold the boards in place on our kreg jig in order to drill them into the 2×3 side edge. To alter the height, you would only need to loosen the set screws on the kee klamp fittings with an allen wrench, make the necessary adjustments, then retighten the screw. One of the simplest coffee tables is a door!</p>
