<p>There is a myth in the comparison of caffeine content between drinking tea and coffee. Its consumption dates back hundreds of years, with recipes differing from region to region, village to village and even household to household. This is less than the average cup of coffee, which contains about 95 milligrams of caffeine. The caffeine content in the dry tea leaves is higher than the same in coffee beans, but after preparation, a single cup of coffee contains more caffeine than a single cup of tea of the same size (usually about half as much). But the fact is that tea leaves, many times, contain more caffeine than coffee beans. However, there are several factors that can determine the exact amount.</p>
