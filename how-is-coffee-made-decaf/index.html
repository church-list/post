The two most popular drinks on earth are tea and coffee, beverages prized for their caffeine boost more than anything else.

<p>Coffee drinking is no longer just a ritual to get your juices flowing, but is now a worldwide culture movement, with decaf coffee in the forefront! Decaf coffee is made in a few different ways but all of them involve treating the coffee beans before they are roasted. There are several different decaffeination methods, each of which leads to subtle differences when the coffee reaches your cup. In this method, the raw beans are treated with a solvent called methylene chloride which binds to the caffeine. Today, decaffeinated coffee accounts for approximately 12% of total worldwide coffee consumption. In early years, those solvents included benzene, chloroform and trichloroethylene, all of which are quite toxic.</p>
