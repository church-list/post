<p><strong>How To Make Blended Coffee Thicker</strong>. Basically anything that is blended/mixed/stirred and served with various topping that are very instagrammable. 5 teaspoons of unsweetened cocoa (substitute for the cocoa, 5 teaspoons vanilla flavoring for the vanilla version or 5 teaspoons caramel flavoring for the caramel version) brew your coffee (i like mine very strong) and then pour into a medium to large size pot. Does extra ice make a frappuccino thicker? You can also mix 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 grams) of instant coffee with enough water to dissolve it.</p>

<p>Continue whipping until the coffee reaches the texture of softly whipped cream or airy pudding. For a thicker consistency, add more ice and blend.

It is one of the favorite desserts that most of us enjoy a few slices along with a cup of coffee. One lot of sweeteners ideally sugar;</p>
