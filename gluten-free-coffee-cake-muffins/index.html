<p>When baking during the holidays, in addition to pleasing different tastes (thank you coffee cake for your unifying appeal), specialty diets can also pose a challenge, especially if you are looking for gluten free baked recipes. This recipe combines protein powder with almond and oat flour to make cinnamon coffee cake muffins that you’ll never know are gluten free. Fluffy vanilla cake, studded with fresh cranberries and topped with a crunchy cinnamon topping. When eaten warm the chocolate chips inside the cake are gooey and satisfying. They only come around this time of year so i always stock up and make all the cranberry things. A muffin is not a quick bread loaf.</p>
