<p>Dip your hair into freshly brewed black coffee once it has cooled to dye your entire head of grey hair, or mix coffee with conditioner to leave the mixture in your hair while the coffee dyes your hair. After 20 minutes, rinse the coffee from your hair with cold or lukewarm water and then pat dry. I save the coffee, in the fridge, that my husband doesn�t drink for 7 days. Or up to one hour. Allow the coffee to collect in the bucket. Then, wash your hair as you normally would do to make sure all the coffee residue is out, and there you go!</p>
