<p><strong>Is Coffee Acidic Or Basic</strong>. Surprisingly, caffeine is alkaline where as the the actual coffee is acidic. However, on a chemical level it is actually relatively complex. Now there are more hydrogen ions than hydroxide ions in the solution. It, along with bananas and soft drinking water, is far less acidic than orange juice.</p>

<p>Aside from formic acid within coffee, we used acids like hydrochloric acid (hcl), with a concentration of 0.1 m, and acetic acid (h3c2ooh) with a concentration of 0.1 m and determined their ph’s, which were both a ph of 1 due to the color red of the ph paper. However, this can be the same as with a large grind of brew coffee. Now there are more hydrogen ions than hydroxide ions in the solution. As it turns out, some types of coffee—such as coffee made from beans harvested at high altitudes and coffees with high caffeine content, to name just two—are. Coffee�s acidity can turn sipping your favorite beverage into an exercise in reflux management. All about coffee acidity… to be completely truthful, most caffeine lovers don’t really bother about whether is coffee acidic or basic.</p>

And the acidity is the same between both instant and brewed coffee. To determine the ph of the acids and bases provided, we received strips of ph. It has a total of nine major acids that contribute to its unique flavour.</p>
