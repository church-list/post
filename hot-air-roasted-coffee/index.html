<p><strong>Hot Air Roasted Coffee</strong>. As a result of hot air being drawn through the coffee, the outer layer of chaff on the bean is blown away quickly in the process. We want you to taste the flavor of the coffee beans (or seeds) and not the roaster! Roasting for filter or espresso? As the chaff pops off, it falls within the roasting chamber and burns into the batch of beans.</p>

<p>This results in a much smoother cup of coffee ! Electric air roasters are especially affected by voltage and ambient temperature. Try us out and see for yourself! This can result in a scorched or bitter taste when brewing the beans. Fluid bed air roasting is a much cleaner roasting process. Air roasted coffee brings out the flavor of the bean with suspended roasting methods.</p>

<p>Unique flavor of air roasted coffee: “life’s too short to drink s#!tty coffee!”. The sivetz hot air roaster allows each bean to develop its naturally distinctive flavor without the smoke and tar contamination that occurs in many roasters. This vortex makes it possible for each and every coffee bean inside the chamber to be perfectly and evenly roasted. Most hot air roasters have a small batch size, good for 1 or 2 people. In the entire world, only 1% of all the coffee beans picked and harvested get the privilege of being air roasted.</p>
