<p>It was kind of bland. Limit one coupon per specified item(s) purchased. I used cinnamon and raisin bagels for this batch but it works as well with any type of cinnamon swirl bread. The staff are very friendly and more than willing to give their favorites of the menu and local recommendations. Cinnamon toast crunch is, hands down, my favorite cereal. We really enjoy breakfast classics like this french toast, or this fluffy and crisp waffle recipe, or these homemade buttermilk pancakes.</p>

<p>Enjoying a bowl of it can immediately transport me back to more carefree days. It was kind of bland. ðŸ¤¤ how good is this french toast swirl creamer? Whip up a quick custard from eggs and the international delight french toast swirl creamer. If you canâ€™t find this (i have a lot of readers who live where itâ€™s not sold, unfortunately!) you can substitute milk or light cream instead, and add vanilla extract and a touch of ground cinnamon.
