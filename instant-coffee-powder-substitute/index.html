<p><strong>Instant Coffee Powder Substitute</strong>. One teaspoon is equivalent to about three ounces of double strength of coffee, now calculate it according to your recipe requirement. Also the coffee is fine but still not as fine as the instant espresso powder and there is a risk that some of the grounds would sink to the bottom of the mixture before it froze fully. To do so, put an equal amount of instant coffee powder or your instant coffee substitute, sugar, and hot water in a bowl. If you aren�t so concerned with the look and authenticity of your espresso and just want a rich coffee flavor for brownies or chocolate cake, instant coffee will do.</p>
