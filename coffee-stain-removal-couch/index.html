<p><strong>Coffee Stain Removal Couch</strong>. Just like with any type of stains brought about by beverages such as tea, coffee or chocolate, the recommended practice is to clean the stained surfaces as quickly as possible before the stains set. Gently rub the stain until it comes out. It should always be the first step in dealing with this kind of damage, you don’t really know what you’re dealing with, or how bad the stain truly is until all of the loose particles have been sucked away by the vacuum. Give it plenty of time to work.</p>
