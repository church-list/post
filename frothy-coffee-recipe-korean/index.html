<p><strong>Frothy Coffee Recipe Korean</strong>. Jennifer gauld/getty images dalgona coffee has easily become one of the most popular quarantine trends, right up there with zoom parties and baking bread. For this creamy and frothy cappuccino, i used the instant coffee powder of nescafe but you can use any coffee brand or even you may use coffee beans if you have a coffee grinder. It�s very sad to not be able to go to starbucks. That�s why i was so happy to find this excellent recipe for a frothy coffee by j�dore on youtube.</p>
