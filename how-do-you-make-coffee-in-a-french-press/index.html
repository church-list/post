<p>Push the plunger down to the bottom. Once you know the volume of coffee you want to brew, replace the 12 in brewed coffee = 12 in the calculator below.

You shouldn’t use a blade grinder because they don’t grind evenly and they make the beans warmer, which takes away the flavor you want in your cup. Once you�ve done that, add your coffee grounds to the press and stir them thoroughly.</p>
