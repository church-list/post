<p>This recipe is so easy and there is only one real trick to getting the flavor and texture of a delicious mocha frappe and that is to use coffee to make the ice cubes. It was quite bitter and not sweet at all. Everything from an iced vanilla latte, iced mocha and iced caramel machiatto, and the three homemade syrups you�ll make will last in the fridge for more summer coffee drinks! Add a lot or little of half &amp; half, depending on how much coffee taste you want. Sugar doesn�t dissolve completely and leaves granules. I had never tried a regular mocha before either, so the combination of decadent chocolate and intense coffee was forever engraved in my mind.</p>

<p>In a blender or food processor, combine the creamer, sugar, coffee granules and cocoa. I’ve shared a bunch of easy coffee recipes on the site in the past, my white chocolate peppermint mocha , eggnog latte , pumpkin spice latte , and caramel macchiato , but this homemade mocha is the easiest of them all. Wendy is absolutely correct to tell us to use ice cubes made of leftover coffee (they don�t dilute the flavor the way regular ice would). Pour the coffee and grounds through cheese cloth and strainer into a bowl. No need to go to your local coffee shop for a good iced coffee. It’s no secret that my morning gets started as soon as the coffee starts flowing.</p>
