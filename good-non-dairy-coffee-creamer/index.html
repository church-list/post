<p><strong>Good Non Dairy Coffee Creamer</strong>. This brand also comes in vanilla, caramel, and hazelnut. One thing we found with this one is that it�s not quite as creamy as other brands. Though i call it hemp “coffee creamer”, since most of mine goes into coffee, it also tastes great in cereals and smoothies and can be used in baking as milk substitute too. It’s made from almonds and coconuts and does not have to be refrigerated until opened.</p>

<p>It didn�t combine well with coffee, no matter how much was added. Place coffee mate vanilla caramel flavor liquid cream granulated sugar and salt in medium saucepan. Although the ingredients can vary by brand, most coffee creamers are made from a combination of water, sugar, and vegetable oil. Because of the underwhelming flavor, this was my least favorite. You can add in a bit of sugar at first, and gradually decrease the amount to give your tastebuds time to adjust. According to registered dietician emily creamer, ms, rd, ldn, reading a product’s ingredient list should act as a guide to what is best for your body.</p>

It tastes so good and is really light! Refrigerate it for a day to thaw it out and shake it well before use.
