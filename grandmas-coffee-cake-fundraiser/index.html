<p><strong>Grandmas Coffee Cake Fundraiser</strong>. It all started with a cinnamon walnut coffee cake made from grandma’s family recipe. That’s my grandma’s favorite dessert that she usually prepares for holidays and other special occasions. Rich, moist, chocolatey, and really yummy! Great served cold and even better served hot when griddled like a grilled cheese sandwich with ice cream on the side!</p>
