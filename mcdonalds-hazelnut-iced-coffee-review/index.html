<p><strong>Mcdonalds Hazelnut Iced Coffee Review</strong>. Unlike the hazelnut iced coffee that i had in kettleman city, the vanilla iced coffee actually tastes. Just add 1/2 tablespoon (7.3 ml) of vanilla extract, hazelnut coffee syrup, or caramel coffee syrup to the pitcher and stir everything together. I asked for a sugar free vanilla iced coffee, got a sugar filled hazelnut iced coffee. It depends on which mcdonald’s you buy your mcdonald’s iced coffee.but some places make it stronger than others.</p>
