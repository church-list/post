<p><strong>Church Coffee Area Ideas</strong>. Seems like a great idea and great concept. I am looking for options for bookshelves/storage along a 10′ wall in a meeting room at our church. I have found a rolling kitchen cart to serve as a coffee bar, but i also need containers for sugar, coffee bags creamer, etc. The church was just outside of the city limits and the folks at city hall didn’t even know that our church was here!</p>

Converted church homes are springing up around the globe, with designers and architects showing their creativity to rework the spaces. People often ask me how to set up a coffee shop in their church or next door to their church. Free subscribers can search and share thousands of articles and resources. One of the finest ways of using a vintage cart at home is to convert it into a coffee bar.</p>

<p>Coffee bars have no strict set of rules, you simply need mugs and a coffee maker, preferably an automatic one.the options when it comes to design are limitless, from fee market salvaged furniture up and pallet wood bars up to extensive bars and dedicated areas you can tailor anything that fits your needs in terms of space and design. Plus, you can make the cart in any size you want based on how large you cut the wood. I am looking for options for bookshelves/storage along a 10′ wall in a meeting room at our church. The coffee station is the place where you can spend your time relaxing and having fun with your family and friend.
