Here are our 15 favorite portable cold brews, spanning nitros to sparkling. As much as i love a steaming hot latte or just a cozy cuppa in the morning ( these coffeeshop copycat recipes are the tops ), once temps start to rise i start to switch from hot coffee mode to cold brew. Before you start brewing, there are a few things to keep in mind so you can create the best coffee for you—a cold brew so good, you ditch the cafe for good (ok, maybe you’ll still stop in for a scone). Is there a certain brand someone could recommend, or a way to tell from the packaging/brand?</p>
