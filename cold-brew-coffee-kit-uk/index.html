<p><strong>Cold Brew Coffee Kit Uk</strong>. Most cold brew coffee makers look like a pitcher with a filter inside for steeping coffee grounds or loose tea. You simply add coffee grounds and cold water to the machine, flip a switch, and wait anywhere from five to 25 minutes for a batch of cold brew concentrate to fill a carafe. Choose from drip filter, aeropress, cafetiere or even cold brew. Cold coffee has long been associated with huge coffee chains, vats of whipped cream, sweet artificial syrups and other such miseries.</p>
