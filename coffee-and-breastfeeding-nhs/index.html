<p>1 mug of filter coffee: Breastfeeding can be really handy and you can do it anywhere (nhs, 2017). Most breastfeeding mothers can consume a moderate amount of caffeine (eg a few cups of coffee or tea each day) without it affecting their babies. Caffeine is a stimulant and can make your baby restless. Caffeine occurs naturally in many foods and drinks, including coffee, tea and chocolate. Though this may seem like a lot at first glance, it can easily add up if you consume coffee or other stimulant beverages more than once a day.</p>
