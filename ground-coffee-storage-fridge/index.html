<p><strong>Ground Coffee Storage Fridge</strong>. Ground coffee can be stored for a week in the refrigerator or two to three weeks in the freezer. The coffee making procedure starts from this point. Place the container in a dry environment away from direct sunlight, and keep the humidity and temperature conditions constant. We don’t recommend the refrigerator or freezer for your daily coffee storage.</p>

<p>Coffee does best stored in a dry, airtight container. In the refrigerator, there is a lot of moisture (just open your fridge to find out!) and both whole bean and especially ground coffee will readily suck up that moisture. Air, moisture, heat, and light. This will definitely have a negative impact on the final taste of your cup of coffee. To keep coffee fresh, store it in an opaque, airtight container at room temperature. That said, keeping coffee beans in an airtight, opaque container in a cool, dry place and grinding them only right before brewing, will make sure that you get.</p>

<p>The best way to store ground coffee is to store it in ways that avoid both mechanisms (i.e., that hold coffee in “equilibrium”) and to avoid high temperatures. It would seem as though the cold, dark climate of the fridge would be good for grounds and beans, but it isn’t. Lock that roasted flavor in by sealing and storing the coffee in a dark spot that�s dry, cool and free of moisture. Forget the freezer, this is how you should be storing your coffee. That said, keeping coffee beans in an airtight, opaque container in a cool, dry place and grinding them only right before brewing, will make sure that you get. Simply freezing it is also a bad idea, if this is all that you do.</p>
