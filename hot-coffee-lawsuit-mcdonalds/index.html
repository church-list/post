<p>The mcdonald�s hot coffee case didn�t change much. The film premiered at the 2011 sundance film festival on january 24, 2011, and later aired on hbo on june 27, 2011, as a part of hbo films documentary summer. The 2011 documentary film hot coffee attempted to debunk the myths surrounding the famous mcdonald�s lawsuit. Hot coffee reveals what really happened to stella liebeck, the albuquerque woman who spilled coffee on herself and sued mcdonald’s, while exploring how and why the case garnered so much media attention, who funded the effort and to what end. The insurance industry and the chamber of commerce have worked very hard to use this lawsuit to make people in the united states believe that tort reform is. Here are the facts of this widely misreported and misunderstood case:</p>
<h3 id="stella-liebeck-79-years-old-was-sitting-in-the-passenger-seat-of-her-grandsons-car-having-purchased-a-cup-of-mcdonalds-coffee">Stella liebeck, 79 years old, was sitting in the passenger seat of her grandson’s car having purchased a cup of mcdonald’s coffee.</h3>
<p>The writing on the cup was not located in a position to serve as an actual warning and mcdonalds admitted to this fact. Mcdonald’s offered liebeck only $800—which did not even cover her medical expenses. The writing on the cup was not located in a position to serve as an actual warning and mcdonalds admitted to this fact. Now, to be clear, liebeck never blamed mcdonald�s for her accident, but rather, took issue with the coffee�s temperature being insanely hot. In the mcdonald�s coffee case, the plaintiff claimed that mcdonald�s knew that its coffee was being served too hot and had in fact received hundreds of complaints about how hot its coffee was. Liebeck sought the help of a personal injury attorney in a law office in santa fe, new mexico.</p>
