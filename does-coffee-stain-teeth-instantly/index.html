<p>The best whitening toothpaste for coffee drinkers to get rid of coffee stains is an excellent coffee stain prevention method for anyone who actually has the time to brush their teeth at a minimum of twice daily ( morning &amp; night). On the other hand, oxidation of tea is enzymatic procedure when. This process is known as extrinsic staining.

<p>At first, it will seem strange to be sipping your hot cup of morning coffee from a straw, but what it does do is prevent contact between the actual coffee and your teeth.

There are all sorts of chemicals in cigarettes, including tobacco, nicotine and tar, that mess with your gum tissue cells and ruin your mouth, weakening it in the face of periodontal diseases and infections. So if you make the choice to drink a coffee that has a reduced amount of caffeine than what you usually drink, you can absolutely prevent coffee teeth stains effectively. Adding milk or cream can reduce the coffee’s staining effect.</p>
