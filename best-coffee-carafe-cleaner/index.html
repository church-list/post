<p>Vinegar is one of the oldest cleaning agents known to humankind. This carafe performs like products made by the iconic brand thermos, so fill it with hot or cold beverages and expect pours to be at proper temperatures. Even worse is the bottom of my chemex carafe, which builds up an ugly residue that no amount of scrubbing with soap has been able to remove. Clean a coffee carafe with vinegar and baking soda use one part baking soda and one part water to make a paste. Vinegar and baking soda make effective cleaners for many surfaces, and that’s no different for coffee carafes of many kinds. A gleaming stainless steel carafe makes a statement in a gleaming kitchen.</p>
