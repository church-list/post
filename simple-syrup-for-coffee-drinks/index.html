<p><strong>Simple Syrup For Coffee Drinks</strong>. Just heat equal parts sugar and water on the stovetop, and the sugar dissolves to form a thick syrup (here’s how to make it).if you’re all out, of course you could just make another batch, as long as you have 5 minutes and some sugar! However, i like to make this syrup a little sweeter, similar to my starbucks classic syrup recipe. But to me, the cold press was still a little bitter, and i was used to a whole bunch of sweet. Then when you try to make one at home, the chocolate syrup from a brown squeeze bottle just doesn�t cut it?</p>
