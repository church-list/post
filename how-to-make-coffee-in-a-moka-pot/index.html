<p><strong>How To Make Coffee In A Moka Pot</strong>. Far less pressure than an espresso machine, but pressure nonetheless. Don’t fill it to the brim but instead only till where the screw is (pic below) and fill the water only until that level. In many parts of south america, this machine is simply referred to as a “coffee maker”; Many italians prefer coffee made with a moka, rather than coffee made with an espresso machine.</p>

<p>Making coffee in your moka pot can be a little frustrating, but it’s also a rewarding method to get the hang of. The slightly pressurized brewing method produces a dense, strong cup of coffee somewhere between drip coffee and espresso. Most people would consider moka pot coffee to be somewhere in between drip coffee and espresso. If you have enough coffee for more than one cup, pour it out of the moka pot into a thermal flask to prevent the coffee tasting harsh and giving it a bitter, metallic edge. Place the moka pot on the stove and allow it to heat. Moka coffee is a very strong, full bodied kind of drink.</p>

<p>Many italians prefer coffee made with a moka, rather than coffee made with an espresso machine. Do not tamp the coffee. Drop the filter basket into place and add a heaping tablespoon of finely ground coffee for every three ounces of water in the pot. Grind your coffee on a drip coffee setting, about as fine as table salt. Continue to let it do this until you begin to hear a gurgling sound. Make sure the filter and rubber gasket are in place.</p>

<p>The moka pot was invented by alfonso bialetti in 1933, and while some specialty coffee folks bristle at the use of the holy word “espresso” to describe the way the moka pot brews coffee, it isn’t that dissimilar to the original turn of the 20th century espresso machines, which used steam to push water up through coffee.</p>
