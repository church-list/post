<p>Keto coffee (bulletproof coffee) is an energizing alternative to traditional coffee drinks that helps people on a ketogenic diet reach and maintain a state of ketosis. Blend up freshly brewed coffee with just four ingredients to create a silky smooth cup of joe bursting with roasted coffee bean aroma. The original keto coffee recipe uses mct oil. Drinking keto coffee every morning helps me feel more satisfied and not very hungry during the day. If you’ve never used mct oil before, start with just 1 teaspoon and slowly increase the amount as your body adjusts. Mct oil is just more concentrated than coconut oil, but both have been shown to aid in fat loss.</p>
