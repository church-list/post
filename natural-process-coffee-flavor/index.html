<p><strong>Natural Process Coffee Flavor</strong>. Who uses the natural process? The whole intact coffee cherry is dried in the sun with the green bean inside.

In this article, we’ll provide a basic understanding of how a particular processing method. Known as “naturals” in the specialty coffee industry, these coffees impart a heavy, expansive mouthfeel and flavor notes that are fruity and complex.
