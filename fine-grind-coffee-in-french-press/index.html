<p>This is a fairly long contact time, so the best french press grind is a coarsely ground bean (check out this post on grinders for french press coffee ). For the best results, you should opt for a medium grind, producing coffee grounds with a texture that is almost similar to breadcrumbs. A finely ground coffee will be too fine for the mesh strainer of your french press to be able to remove the coffee particles. The key is letting the coffee steep for long enough to make a strong brew. French press requires a consistently coarse grind, but shouldn’t cost you more than about $100 or so for something that will work nicely for both french press and drip. Today i zoned out and ground everything finely, and i don�t have beans left for another batch.</p>
