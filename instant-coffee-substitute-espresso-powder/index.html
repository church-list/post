I wouldn�t expect the original recipes to use ground coffee, it is more likely that espresso powder means instant espresso here, which would dissolve in baked goods.</p>

Some people also feel that the taste is harsher and less rounded than the espresso coffee. Typically, instant coffee has a bit less caffeine than regular ground coffee.
