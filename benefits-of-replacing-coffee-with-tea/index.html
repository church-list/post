<p><strong>Benefits Of Replacing Coffee With Tea</strong>. Switching over from coffee to green tea may also help the bacterial population in your mouth in general. For a frame of reference, an average cup of coffee has about 90 mg of caffeine while a shot of espresso has 60 mg, and a standard cup of steeped green tea has 12 mg. This flavorful twist on classic green tea, by yogi, will give you all the same health benefits as coffee (such as speeding up your metabolism) along with a refreshing, fruity flavor. Replacing coffee with green tea might not cause all the symptoms of caffeine withdrawal since green tea contains approximately 20 to 30 milligrams of caffeine per cup.</p>

While green and white teas do contain some caffeine, it is significantly less than the amount found in coffee and will not leave you feeling jittery. If you’re thinking, “coffee has much more caffeine than tea,” you’re not wrong. Switching over from coffee to green tea may also help the bacterial population in your mouth in general.
