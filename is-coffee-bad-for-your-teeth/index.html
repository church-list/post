<p><strong>Is Coffee Bad For Your Teeth</strong>. When you eat sugary foods or sip sugary drinks for long periods of time, plaque bacteria use that sugar to produce acids that attack your enamel, the hard surface of your tooth. Black coffee has an average ph of 5. This bad habit can wear away your teeth�s enamel and in severe cases, cause your teeth to chip or break. If you’re going to consume soda and other sugary beverages, be smart about it to keep your teeth protected.</p>

<p>So, it would seem that in one way, coffee is good for your teeth, yet in another way, it is not. This can cause your teeth to become thin and brittle. Deeper stains can often be lifted by professional whitening. But is coffee as bad for our teeth as it seems? Coffee has a low ph making it acidic in nature. You might love a cup of coffee before bedtime, but studies show it often causes you to clench your teeth while you sleep.</p>
<h3 id="perhaps-not-according-to-a-new-study">Perhaps not, according to a new study.</h3>
<p>This can cause your teeth to become thin and brittle. It’s common knowledge how bad coffee stains your teeth, and coffee stains are among the worst for your teeth as they are very resistant. Drinking too much of liquids that are high in acid, like coffee, can weaken your enamel. Sugar is a popular additive to coffee, too, and can increase one�s risk of cavities in the same way as soda. Unfortunately, coffee is known for leaving stains behind (and no one likes stained teeth!). A morning cup of coffee is a daily routine for millions of people.</p>
