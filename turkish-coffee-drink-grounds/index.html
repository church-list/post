<p><strong>Turkish Coffee Drink Grounds</strong>. These include the use of an ibrik or cezve when brewing, the grind of coffee beans, and the foam produced. In simple terms, turkish coffee has the coffee grounds floating in the brew, with a dark layer at the base of the cup. This makes the drink so special and unique among coffee lovers. The grounds left after drinking turkish coffee have been used to tell fortunes.</p>

<p>Traditional turkish coffee is served with a glass of water (to drink before the coffee) and something sweet, like a turkish delight, to eat after the coffee. We have never heard a turkish person say they don’t like türk kahvesi. Even espresso is made with grounds significantly coarser and larger than turkish coffee, and the ground coffee you use to make conventional coffee is far too. Traditionally, coffee is added to cold water in a copper pot. It’s got plenty of coffee grounds on the bottom of the cups, and is not usually served with any milk or creamer. Thus, you extract more flavors than any other method of brewing.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-make-turkish-coffee">How to make turkish coffee.</h3>
<p>Before you drink your turkish coffee, you must let it sit in the cup for a small while so you can give the coffee grounds. There are several features that set this special beverage apart from other varieties. Thus, you extract more flavors than any other method of brewing. Never stir the coffee once it’s in the cups; The water served alongside the coffee, contrary to popular belief, is not meant to be drunk after the coffee. It has one such tradition where the coffee is prepared via hot sand, and that’s got to be one of the most charming ways to make coffee.</p>
