<p><strong>How Much Coffee For Cold Brew</strong>. But this is not always the case and many people who like cold brew tend to use twice as much coffee grounds for their drink, and even more than that. A cup of cold brew coffee that came from a cold brew batch at 400 grams may contain up to 200 mg of caffeine, while a hot cup of traditional coffee may only contain 170 mg.

The standard advice for those that weigh when they make a cold brew concentrate is to use a 4 to 1 brewing ratio.</p>
