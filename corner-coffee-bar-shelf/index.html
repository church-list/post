<p>This diy creates a beautiful and functional coffee bar from reclaimed wood, and a durable concrete top was molded to fit the wood base. This is not just any corner bar. No need for breaking the bank to get this piece of heaven. Using a wide array of bright colors is worth trying. We’re more than happy to tell you that you can manage even a small space at the corner for a coffee bar. To recreate the look, snag a distressed freestanding buffet ($172) or sideboard and pair it with wrought iron and white ceramic accents.</p>
