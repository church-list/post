<p>If you base it on the geographical map of the world, colombia is the perfect place to grow and cultivate coffee. Coffee was first grown commercially in colombia in salazar de las palmas, north of santander, and over the twentieth century grew to be colombia�s primary export.when coffee was first brought into the country, the leaders tried to push the farming of coffee beans, but was met with resistance from the people because it takes about 5 years until the first harvest of the bean. These are coffea arabica and coffea robusta (or coffea canephora, depending on which botanist you ask).of the two, it is arabica that is the most appreciated for its deeper flavor and richer qualities, though some regions such as vietnam and parts of africa prefer the bitter, earthy flavors in robusta. Colombia has traditionally grown arabica beans and its unique geography makes it perfectly suited for producing a delicious, high quality brew 1.colombia’s excellent growing conditions have paired with an aggressive marketing campaign by the national federation of coffee growers (fnc), which has worked. Colombia has ideal growing conditions for coffee, with rich volcanic soil, high altitudes for growing and a good amount of rainfall. Colombia’s coffee country covers vast regions of andes mountain range farming landscapes, where scenic coffee farms set on misty slopes and nestled within lush foothills generously produce smooth bodied brews.</p>
