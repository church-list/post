<p><strong>Rum And Coffee Name</strong>. This cocktail gets its dubious title from the cruzan black strap rum that is floated on the top of the drink, making it look like a dark oil spill. Rather, it is a blend of salvadoran and jamaican rums sourced from worthy park estate, hampden, and monymusk distilleries. With this cardamom coffee concentrate, vanilla simple syrup, heavy cream, and some vodka, this cardamom and vanilla coffee cocktail from offbeat and inspired is rich, robust, and delicious. Well done, i look forward to trying more from the finders range.</p>
