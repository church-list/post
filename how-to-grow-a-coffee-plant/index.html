<p><strong>How To Grow A Coffee Plant</strong>. The good news is that coffee plants are awesome. Even if you don’t, you can grow coffee inside in containers. Unprocessed coffee cherries are the best option for growing your own coffee plants. You can find seedlings in stores like safeway or wholefoods or even online.</p>

<p>The freshness of the seeds also hastens the sprouting process. Before you begin growing your coffee plant, you need to dedicate a space to it. Dig holes roughly that are 20 inches (50 cm) in depth, width, and length. If, however, you do happen to reside in a coffee producing country, pick ripe coffee cherries by hand, pulp them, wash. You could grow coffee beans from seeds, but they can take 3 to 4 years to bear fruit. At its full size, your coffee plant might reach up to 10 feet tall!</p>

<p>Therefore, provide enough space for the plant or make pruning a regular part of caring for your coffee plant. Coffee plants may bloom twice per season, producing smaller, less showy flowers in late summer. You can find seedlings in stores like safeway or wholefoods or even online. Coffee is relatively straightforward to grow, especially if you live in a tropical or subtropical climate. If you grow coffee cuttings, you can be picking, roasting, grinding and brewing your own beans in as few as 18 months. You can either use seeds from a plant you’re growing or seek fresh seeds elsewhere if you want to explore different flavors.</p>
