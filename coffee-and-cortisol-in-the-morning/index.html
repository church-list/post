<p><strong>Coffee And Cortisol In The Morning</strong>. That means your morning cup of coffee or tea isn’t going to spike your cortisol levels higher than they are, but that evening brew may delay the downward curve that your body needs to get adequate sleep. Well, since we now know that our cortisol levels are sufficiently high in the morning, it doesn’t make sense (to me, at least recently) to consume an artificial energy booster as strong as coffee. A common argument against drinking coffee is that it triggers cortisol release, but (forgive me for getting nitpicky) that may not be true. Cortisol is produced by your adrenal glands and helps regulate metabolism.</p>
