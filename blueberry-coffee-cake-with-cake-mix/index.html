<p><strong>Blueberry Coffee Cake With Cake Mix</strong>. This recipe is one from a local b&amp;b that i replaced all the sugar with substitutes because i have diabetes. I like to use my hands because i find it easier to mix that way. Mix 1 brown cup sugar, 2/3 cup flour, and cinnamon in a medium bowl. Beat with spoon 30 seconds.</p>
