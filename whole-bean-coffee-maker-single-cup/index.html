<p>Why bean to cup coffee machines are popular. This reviewer sums it up pretty well: The total 1 is a top quality coffee machine that delivers delicious single serve coffee from the bean to your cup. Nothing beats freshly brewed coffee in the morning, especially when you’ve found the best whole bean coffee that meets your taste and caffeine needs. It won’t make any sense of wanting a machine with features beyond your budget. Once beans have been ground, they immediately start to lose their flavour.</p>
