<p>This page is about the analysis results regarding potassium. The main difference is found in potassium levels, with ground coffee having more than double the potassium of instant. Caloric ratio pyramid™ this graphic shows you what percentage of the calories in a food come from carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and alcohol. All the hospital have given me is one sheet of paper with a list of high/medium/low potassium content foods &amp; drinks on it and i found tea &amp; coffee were both in the high catagory so i�ve been totally avoiding them. While coffee is the key to this article, potassium is the focus. Want to use it in a meal plan?</p>
<h3 id="coffee-is-technically-not-one-of-the-high-potassium-foods-because-it-does-not-provide-200-mg-of-potassium-in-a-single-serving">Coffee is technically not one of the high potassium foods because it does not provide 200 mg of potassium in a single serving.</h3>
<p>If you drink several cups a day, it can be a source of a great deal of potassium. Coffee is technically not one of the high potassium foods because it does not provide 200 mg of potassium in a single serving. The total fat content of (1 cup serving) instant coffee is 0 g. Six cups would provide between 690 to 780 mg of potassium in a day. But coffee also has advantages beyond its ability to provide large amounts of potassium, and thus aid in the prevention of hypertension, osteoporosis, and kidney stones. The information may encourage you to buy potassium supplements, which is problematic.</p>
