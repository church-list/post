<p><strong>Coffee Chocolate Chip Ice Cream Recipe</strong>. Almost 2 months ago, i had the privilege to head out to santa barbara, california and meet up with some blog friends. My goal for spring/summer 2014 is to make more ice cream. This chocolate chip ice cream is super easy to prepare and is similar to the chocolate ice cream i had posted earlier. In a small saucepan heat the milk with the ice cream over medium heat whisking as it heats, until the mixture simmers and becomes foamy.</p>

<p>I tried a bunch of other brands of coffee ice cream, but none even came close to the rich, creamy flavor of mocha java chip, so i began experimenting on my own. Place the milk, 1 cup of the cream, sugar, salt, and coffee beans in a medium saucepan and heat on medium heat until little bubbles form at the edge of the pan and the milk cream mixture is steamy.remove from heat, cover, and let sit for 1 hour. It’s like a frappe in ice cream form. A coffee lover’s dream come true! 1 steep the coffee beans in milk, cream, with sugar and salt, then strain: First, in a stand mixer or large mixing bowl, whip the heavy cream until it starts to form stiff peaks.</p>

<p>The ice cream is refreshing, and it makes a great treat to serve any time of the day. Five minutes prior to the end of churning, cut a small snip in the corner of the bag and drizzle thin lines of melted chocolate into the ice cream. Coffee chip ice cream combines the deliciousness of coffee with dark chocolate covered espresso bits or chocolate chips for the perfect coffee ice cream flavor. The difference in temperature between the ice cream and the meted chocolate will cause the chocolate to harden and crack, creating wonderful chocolate chips.
