<p><strong>How To Make Frothy Coffee In Microwave</strong>. Mix together the whipped coffee and the milk for a frothy coffee treat. The jar should not be more than halfway full. Even without an espresso machine, a milk frother, or other toys of the trade, you can make a pretty decent latte at home — and yes, it will have a beautiful cap of foam. If you like hot frothy milk on your coffee or you want to make an indulgent treat, you can use your microwave too.</p>

<p>Dilute coffee powder in 1 cup hot water. Place in mason jar and shake until frothy, about 30 seconds. Mix together the whipped coffee and the milk for a frothy coffee treat. Pour the microwaved water over the coffee grounds. Remove the lid and microwave the jar for 30 seconds. Then, (without the lid!), microwave on high for 45 seconds to 1 minute.</p>

<p>Shake the jar as hard as you can until the milk is froth and has roughly doubled in volume, 30 to 60 seconds. Using a spoon to restrain the foam, pour the hot milk into the prepared coffee. Combine milk foam and espresso. This takes us about 30 seconds. You can’t steam milk without a steamer, but you can make frothy milk for lattes and cappuccinos in a cafetière, according to jordon. Now, if you’re like me, you probably like your coffee with a little froth or foam on the top.</p>
