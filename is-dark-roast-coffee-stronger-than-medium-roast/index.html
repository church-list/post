The beans are roasted to the beginning or middle of the second crack — about 225°c (437°f) or 230°c (446°f). Surprisingly, the answer is no, because the strength of your coffee doesn�t depend on the type of roast. During the roasting process, moderate beans are going to have moderate brown coloring rather than be greasy. Medium roast coffee is a brown color and rarely has an oily surface.</p>
