<p><strong>Italian Press Coffee Grind</strong>. Fine espresso grind will sometimes push through the screen and rise to the upper chamber with the coffee resulting in a bit of fine grit in your drink, similar to what you’d find in the bottom of your french press coffee. You think you have your daily cup of joe down to a science—but do you? Pour all coffee out of carafe after. If you want to get the perfect grind for french press goes with a coarse or medium grind.</p>

<p>Moka pots are a lot like french press coffee in that there is always sediment in your cup. Espresso is a brewed through using pressure (approximately 9 bar) to force water through compacted coffee grounds. The french press brewing method is just one of a variety of ways to create a cup of coffee through steeping coarse grounds in extremely hot water. By doing so, you can adjust the grinder multiple times without ruining all your coffee beans. The need for maximum water surface area for extraction process is important. I added 42 grams of coffee, ground to the french press setting on my grinder, to the carafe.</p>
