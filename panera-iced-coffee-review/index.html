<p>I prefer getting this as opposed to any sized vanilla iced latte at starbucks because 1) it�s cheaper 2) there is no ice in it, it�s just chilled, so you get more liquid as opposed to the half cup of ice that is poured into your iced latte when you ask for it made and 3) it�s a lot sweeter and smoothr than when starbucks actually makes the coffee. If you’re always popping into the same coffee shop for a quick cup—and that coffee shop just happens to be panera—you might want to get a subscription. A subscriber can have a free beverage. The quality of panera bread® coffee starts at the farms where our coffee is grown. Starbucks flavor varies as well as to be expected but their the most consistent and you can get a giant cup for 3 bucks while you�ll generally pay more for a smaller amount elsewhere. The service offers unlimited hot coffee, iced coffee and hot tea (with unlimited refills of the same beverage each day) for just $8.99 a month at.</p>
