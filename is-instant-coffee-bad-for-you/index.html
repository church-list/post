<p>Whether you are burning the midnight oil studying for your college finals and the nearest starbucks is closed, or you are in need of an early morning caffeine buzz and forgot to go grocery shopping, instant coffee doesn�t require a coffee maker, and is an easy way to whip up a quick cup of java without investing a whole lot of time in the process. Coffee is life, and you should never feel bad about drinking it. Before we analyse the health differences between instant and ground coffee, let�s all agree on one thing: “the instant coffee people have been phenomenally inventive in trying to extract the aromatics in brewing and trying to put it back in the coffee,” davids said.

However, an equivalent sized cup of instant coffee only provides about 63 mg.</p>

<p>Instant coffee is much better than it used to be and, if you think about it, kind of amazing. Like regular brewed coffee, instant coffee may be associated with health benefits, like reduced risk of many diseases, improved mental and physical performance and boosted metabolism.

Instant gets a bad rep in the coffee community. Whether you are burning the midnight oil studying for your college finals and the nearest starbucks is closed, or you are in need of an early morning caffeine buzz and forgot to go grocery shopping, instant coffee doesn�t require a coffee maker, and is an easy way to whip up a quick cup of java without investing a whole lot of time in the process.</p>
