So, if you have been wondering why coffee makes you sleepy, it is important that you find better ways to cope with that feeling. Although caffeine prevents your brain from receiving adenosine, it doesn’t stop your body from producing the neurotransmitter. Coffee itself won’t instantly make you feel tired, but the caffeine it contains may actually lead to fatigue after regularly drinking it over time. If you stick to 400 mg of caffeine per day.</p>
