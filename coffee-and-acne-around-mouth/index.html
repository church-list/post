<p><strong>Coffee And Acne Around Mouth</strong>. Before i had this problem i always had clear skin with only a few pimples here and there. Contact dermatitis can occur around the mouth due to exposure to lip makeup, hair removal products, shaving cream, aftershave, or other products used primarily in the affected area. Prevention tips include not touching the face, avoiding certain products, and using medications. Breakouts on the chin may actually be caused by perioral dermatitis, or hormonal acne.</p>
