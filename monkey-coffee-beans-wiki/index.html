<p>These coffee beans are picked out from monkey excrement and are then used to make coffee. Coffee is a brewed beverage served throughout the wheel. Surely this is dirtier or as dirty as pig meat, right? However, despite its misleading name, monkey poop coffee doesn’t actually fit in the category of animal poop (or intestinally fermented) coffees. They can be harvested to receive 1 coffee beans after which they will need 4 to 5 days to regrow. This item is used in the creation of the black coffee.</p>

The roasted coffee beans is a food component from the tropicraft mod. If thermal expansion is installed, this recipe will be available.</p>
