<p>Delete my coffee bean card. My family and i have already been fans of coffee bean even before they were certified, since we knew that they are not providing food which contains pork or lard. They are famous for their the coffee bean tea leaf and food for thought. 110, jalan love lane, kampung baru sungai buloh, 40160 shah alam, selangor. Thanks for the a2a if it is about coffee and just that then it is totally halal. We’ve had readers send us messages for years giving us tips on what to try (spicy tuna pasta anyone?) when we’re there.</p>
