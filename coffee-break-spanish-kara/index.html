<p>You will quickly learn to communicate in spanish alongside kara, and by listening to her questions and hearing her mistakes you�ll make excellent progress towards your goal of speaking and understanding spanish. Another audio course that i have found very helpful is coffee break spanish (link takes you to the first free lessons). As a learner kara asks questions, and makes mistakes, so through mark�s explanations, corrections and pronunciation tips. If any scottish educators are heading to the scottish learning festival this week then do come along to the apple stand where i�m going to be demonstrating podcasting along with kara. In lesson 5 mark and kara look further at making arrangements using the tricky spanish verb quedar. What exactly is included in the premium courses depends a bit on the season.</p>
