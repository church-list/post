For coffee and tea, we’re good — we’re taking in more liquid than we lose to extra urination. Some people say that drinking caffeinated drinks, such as tea and coffee, will dehydrate you. Individuals consume caffeine because it is considered to be psychoactive as it stimulates the brain and central nervous system within 10 to 45 minutes of ingestion.
