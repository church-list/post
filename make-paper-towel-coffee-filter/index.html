<p><strong>Make Paper Towel Coffee Filter</strong>. Can i use a bounty paper towel as a coffee filter? To make the filter, fold two towels in half and cross them over each other in. The coffee filters may have fibers or plastic on them when you take them out of the plastic packaging. A gf3 paper filter will partly screen everything from one to four microns.</p>

Fold a couple of paper towels and tuck them into the coffee maker to form a makeshift filter. Only use paper towels as a filter on rare occasions because the paper towel falls apart easily. You can make a normal 2 layer face mask with a filter pocket (here are some face mask sewing patterns if you need them), and just insert 4 layers of paper towel inside. Insult the fines left on the paper towel.</p>
