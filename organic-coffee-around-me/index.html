Around 75 % of organic coffee comes from latin america so the natural friendly process of production is very important if we have in mind the consumption of trees in amazon rainforest and also the pollution of the rivers caused by the modern factories.

The organic coffee variety is grown without the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, on land that has had a sufficient amount of time to detoxify itself from any chemicals or modified organisms.</p>
