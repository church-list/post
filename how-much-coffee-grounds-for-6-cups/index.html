<p>For all we know, there are a lot of things that could determine the yield from a pound of coffee based on some factors such as your personal taste preference and how much coffee did you use upon brewing. For a tasty cup of coffee using a drip coffee maker, measure coffee grounds by using 2 rounded tablespoons (around 10 grams) per 6 ounces of water. You can double the measurements if you want stronger coffee. I�d use 8 heaping tablespoons for good coffee and 6 tablespoons for canned.and if you must drink canned coffee, go with a good brand: Anyway, a 1lb bag of coffee beans will make 16 cups of 16 oz coffee assuming the same measurements of 4 tablespoons, or 1 oz of coffee to make a 16 oz cup of coffee. For 8 cups, you will need 8 or 16 tablespoons of ground coffee, depending on the size of the cup.</p>
