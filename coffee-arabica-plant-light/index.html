<p><strong>Coffee Arabica Plant Light</strong>. The coffee plant or c.arabica originated in the arabian peninsula and the mountains of yemen. Bright indirect light is best for strong, healthy growth. Coffea arabica is also found on mount marsabit in northern kenya, but it is unclear whether this is a truly native or naturalised occurrence. Coffee plants are understory shrubs, so they should not be grown in direct sunlight which will burn the foliage.</p>
