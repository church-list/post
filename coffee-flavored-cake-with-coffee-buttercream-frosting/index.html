<p><strong>Coffee Flavored Cake With Coffee Buttercream Frosting</strong>. In my opinion, the key to a great coffee and walnut cake is a really good coffee buttercream, so i’ve been busy in the kitchen getting mine just right. Don’t miss our full collection of favorite cake and frosting recipes in our recipes section! (ii) the size of the cake is ideal for a small gathering, i.e., it produces a one layer 9″ cake. While your cake is baking, you can whip up a batch of one of these creative flavored icings to top it off.</p>

<p>This coffee buttercream frosting uses instant coffee to give cakes and cupcakes an unforgettable topper. I’m always going to lean towards chocolate cakes when pairing coffee (or in this cake kahlua espresso) flavors of frosting. This mocha cake is a dense and moist coffee flavored cake with a decadent kahlua coffee frosting. Frosting is much simpler (and quicker) to make from scratch than cake batter. This mocha buttercream frosting is delicious, easy to make, and is a great consistency for piping! If it is too thick, you can add a little more powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Don’t miss our full collection of favorite cake and frosting recipes in our recipes section! To get the coffee flavour into my buttercream i prefer to use instant coffee rather than stuff made in a proper coffee machine. Rich chocolate cake flavored with coffee and topped with a creamy coffee buttercream. If it made the twice the amount i would still finish it equally fast. Give your usual buttercream frosting a kick with instant coffee. This mocha cake is a dense and moist coffee flavored cake with a decadent kahlua coffee frosting.</p>
