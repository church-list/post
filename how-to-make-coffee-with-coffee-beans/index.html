<p><strong>How To Make Coffee With Coffee Beans</strong>. But if your grinder breaks down or you find yourself somewhere that doesn’t have one, there are still a number of ways that you can grind your beans for a fresh cup of java. Don�t grind more than you�ll use in a day or two, for the best flavor, and keep the powdered coffee in an airtight bag or container. Weigh out 17.5g of coffee beans.
