<p><strong>Coffee Berry Plant Edible</strong>. Fruit and flowers of this plant are edible. The kawaiisu indians used mashed coffeeberry leaves, sap and the berries themselves to halt bleeding and aid in the healing of burns, infections and other wounds. Once it matures, the cherry typically turns red, with some turning yellow depending on the variety. If you can find it, i highly recommend cloudberry jelly.</p>
