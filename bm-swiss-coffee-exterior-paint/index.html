<p><strong>Bm Swiss Coffee Exterior Paint</strong>. It is a beautiful, warm, creamy hue that is versatile, tranquil, and works great with earthy colors. Awesome job thanks for sharing!! The paint color almost had hints of gold, too. I think the timid looks best for what you�ve described you�re looking for.</p>

<p>It pairs nicely with bright white trim too, giving just enough of a contrast without reading too yellow. How did you decide on paint colors? We painted our windows the same color as the walls, swiss coffee, by benjamin moore at 75% strength. If you need help finding the perfect paint color for your home and want it to be professionally done. I think the swiss coffee is a bit murky, and the linen white seems somewhat peachy. Here are some other greige paint colors you should check out;</p>

<p>I would not use a lighter white than white dove in a darker or north facing room. I think the swiss coffee is a bit murky, and the linen white seems somewhat peachy. K on may 5, 2020 at 12:59 pm. Out of all the white paint colors i reviewed, swiss coffee had the yellowest hue. Also look at bm mayonnaise and bm capitol white, which i think looks like the cleanest white with some yellow undertone in it of all of them. I would not use a lighter white than white dove in a darker or north facing room.</p>
