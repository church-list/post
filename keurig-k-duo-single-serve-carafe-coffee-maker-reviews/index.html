<p>The perfect brewer for any occasion. Single water reservoir that is shared between single serve and carafe brewing, which means fewer water refills to save you time. Makes a great single serve cup of coffee — brew comes out nice and steaming hot — hotter than my previous keurig. We are back with yet another one of our favorites from keurig. As always my reviews are fair and honest, and non bias, to give a potential customer an objective review, the good and or bad if any. The perfect coffee maker for any occasion.</p>
