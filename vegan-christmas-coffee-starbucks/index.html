<p><strong>Vegan Christmas Coffee Starbucks</strong>. The coffee chain debuted their brand new holiday menu, featuring a vegan wrap, a turkey sandwich and so much more. In 2013, the coffee team decided it was time to create a new identity for holiday blend, and a unique recipe that also features bright latin american and smooth indonesian coffees was born. I hope you fellow vegan coffe/starbucks/ christmas lovers enjoyed this and found it helpful. Starbucks is one of the most vegan friendly coffee shops in the nation.</p>

The coffee chain debuted their brand new holiday menu, featuring a vegan wrap, a turkey sandwich and so much more. Historically, starbucks® holiday blend had been the same coffee as starbucks® christmas blend, but with a different name.</p>
