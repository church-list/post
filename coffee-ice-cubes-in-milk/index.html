<p>Fill a tall glass with 1/3 coffee ice cubes, 1/3 milk ice cubes, and 1/3 water ice cubes. Even if you‚Äôre not a die hard coffee addict, this flavored ice cube is the training wheels to coffee addiction‚Ä¶not kidding. In a liquid measuring cup, combine iced coffee, milk and chocolate milk mix. Just brew coffee (hot or cold brew) and freeze in ice cube trays. Fill 2 ice cube trays with mixture. Alternate until the tray is filled to the top.</p>

<p>Hi, thank you for your interest in my works! Coffee ice cubes are such a simple, obvious solution to the problem of watery iced coffee that i‚Äôm a little embarrassed it took me this long to give it a try. Once this first layer has frozen (about two hours), add a layer of milk. Leftover coffee ice cubes can be used for regular iced coffees and smoothies. Cover tightly and refrigerate 5 hours or overnight (if using whole beans, up to 24 hours). Cover and process until combined.</p>
