<p>Drinking caffeine during pregnancy has been linked to declined placental blood flow and a risk of miscarriage. During pregnancy, high blood pressure can be a sign of preeclampsia, a potentially dangerous condition that can affect the woman and her unborn baby. Hypertension (hpt) is a major risk factor for cvd and related diseases as well as for diseases leading to a marked increase in cardiovascular risk (reference mancia, de backer and dominiczak 1). And this effect of caffeine on blood pressure is stronger the higher your blood pressure is already. Other negative side effects of caffeine include high blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, increased anxiety, dizziness, restlessness, abdominal pain and diarrhea (2, 13). It�s a stimulant, so it can raise your heart rate and blood pressure.</p>
