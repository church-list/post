<p><strong>Community Coffee Chicory New Orleans Blend</strong>. It is the original coffee &amp; chicory blend, which has a little more bite to it than the new orleans version. Review 12 3 chicory orleans blend community two 2016 bb 035700877041 ground oz coffee. Since union and community new orleans blend were the top two, i bought both of them. I brew it extra strong and it not only makes great hot coffee, but especially wonderful ice coffee.</p>

The wrong labeling is the only reason i�m giving 4 stars instead of 5. Nothing can replace coffee, but chicory serves as the next best alternative.

<p>This is a bag of ground coffee, with roasted chicory included in the mix. I got hooked on chicory coffee in new orleans and a friend had me try community coffee with chicory. Well, i�m hooked on community coffee in general. Chicory coffee is made from the roots of the flowering chicory plant.
