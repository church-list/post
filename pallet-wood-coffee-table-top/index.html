<p>The top of a table is a pallet and the legs and pieces taken from another pallet. It pretty much only requires that you sand then paint or apply thin wood stain on the pallet, add wheels and finally lay a piece of glass on top. Cut the wood to the thickness of your tabletop, plus an additional 1/8″. I know pallet furniture such as pallet coffee tables aren’t for everyone or every home, but it’s a decent consideration especially if you have low cost or free access to pallets. Coffee table or laptop wood pallet tables ranges in so many designs, styles and variations from which you can freely opt for the one that matches best with the beauty of your house setting. It matches the decor for my sitting room so i made a base and attached it to the top.</p>
