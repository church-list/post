<p>There are many new, exciting players popping up around town for coffee nerds and newbies alike. The way the caffeine buzz affects you depends on the roast, bean type, and other factors. Even a caffeine addict like me feels at least 1 out of 3 buzz�s after having a bowl (or eating half the pint straight out of the container)! Review it is only fitting that i am reviewing this flavor right before finals week when i need all of the coffee i can get. The less common robusta species of coffee bean will typically have around twice the caffeine as the common arabica you find the grocery store. Whatever the case may be, it�s now in pints for your eating pleasure.</p>

The less common robusta species of coffee bean will typically have around twice the caffeine as the common arabica you find the grocery store.
