<p><strong>Cold Brew Coffee French Press Reddit</strong>. Though not technically a “cold brew maker”, the french press is a very popular option for those who don’t want to buy a dedicated cold brew device. You can make it in a french press coffee maker that you might already have hidden in your cabinet, or even in a plain old mason jar. Add 4 oz of coarse ground coffee to the bottom of the french press. Or keep it simple and just add a little homemade almond milk.</p>
