<p><strong>Red Wagon Coffee Table</strong>. 15 to 17 inches is typical for coffee table legs. The red wagon restaurant in poseyville serves signature authentic homestyle dishes that we are noted for, like shrimp creole, gumbo, gator tail, red beans and rice, jambalaya and crawfish. A piece of glass gives it an even, flat top but you could skip the glass and just set items directly in the wagon. She had glass cut to fit the top and used it like a shadow box.</p>
