<p>Ideally, you want them stored in a cool, dry place, away from sunlight and heat. Raw coffee in beans has a different profile of caffeine than roasted beans because the roasting process draws out part of the caffeine. Exactly how much caffeine is in your cup is going to depend on a few different factors including the type of coffee bean, how much coffee is brewed, the way coffee beans are roasted, the type of coffee (or way it is served) and the serving size. Plunger or french press has 80 to 135 mg caffeine (107.5 mg as an average). There are approximately 6 milligrams of caffeine in a roasted coffee bean.

<p>And because each coffee bean has about the same amount of caffeine, this means the 25 grams of dark roast will contain slightly more caffeine.

However, dark roast beans are smaller due to moisture loss caused by prolonged roasting. Light and dark roast coffee beans contain almost identical caffeine levels; This helps assure the beans are free from pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides.</p>
