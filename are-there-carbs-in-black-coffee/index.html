<p>I checked the label and it lists as 3g of carbs. And only 9 calories in each cup. Now, coffee tends to be a pretty big deal to many and when you start adding all kinds of condiments to your steaming beverage, it’s not so simple anymore. I cannot explain why this is. Then you’d be back to 5 calories, loose some weight, and enjoy doing it. All of this helps you to lose weight, along with the antioxidants that are also naturally occurring.</p>

<p>2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice. I have done a search for black coffee on other websites and they are also saying 0 carbs, so i think. Ingredient specific calorie information from our recipes: I cannot explain why this is. I�ve been drinking a lot of japanese instant coffee (black, unflavoured, unsweetened), but i�m just a bit perturbed by the carb count on the labels. All of this helps you to lose weight, along with the antioxidants that are also naturally occurring.</p>
