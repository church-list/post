<p><strong>Where Is Coffee Grown In Brazil</strong>. Coffee grown in brazil is predominantly of the arabica variety, making up around 80% of the total crop. These are coffea arabica and coffea robusta (or coffea canephora, depending on which botanist you ask).of the two, it is arabica that is the most appreciated for its deeper flavor and richer qualities, though some regions such as vietnam and parts of africa prefer the bitter, earthy flavors in robusta. Columbia is second with about 2/3rds of brazil�s production. These are the main regions that pump the best and most coffee in the world.</p>
