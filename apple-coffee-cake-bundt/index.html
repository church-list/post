<p>This recipe is for a coffee cake studded with fresh apple chunks and with a crumble topping. We had a few leftover apples and needed to use them quickly. The key to getting your apple cake (or any bundt cake) to release easily from the pan is is greasing your bundt pan quite generously, with nonstick cooking spray or melted shortening. This apple coffee cake recipe makes a sweet breakfast treat! The layer of nuts, sugar, and spice is just the icing on—or rather in—the cake, adding lots of flavor and crunch. Studded with chunks of apple, scented with cinnamon, and finished with a sweet and tangy cream cheese glaze, this gorgeous bundt cake is the very best way to welcome fall weather.</p>
