<p>This product is perfect for first time coffee grinders because it is very basic and all that is needed is to fill up the hopper and you’re ready to start grinding. This manual coffee bean grinder is made of stainless steel with ceramic conical burrs. A zassenhaus coffee grinder is always manually operated (there are no electric coffee grinders as yet). For this reason, a zassenhaus coffee grinder is considerably more expensive than the average. It is not as fancy as the 169dg in appearance, but is still quite nice to look at. If you think you know what a hand grinder should look like, think again.</p>

<p>Overall, we love the look of this best manual coffee grinder. It’s been in my relatives home in munich for 149 years. The zassenhaus ‘santiago’ is uniquely designed with a gorgeous mahogany finish and golden accents. The original zassenhaus conical burr grinder, machined from high grade tool steel and hardened, guarantees to produce a proper grind, suitable for any coffee. It’s crafted by artisans, and the company has been in grinder production for over 150 years. This model uses beech wood for its cubic body, and a chrome finish for its short, cylindrical hopper.</p>

<p>Moreover, these are products of enormous quality in manufacture, and often use noble materials (olive wood, beech, metals) in their manufacture.</p>

<p>Zassenhaus has been making grinders for more than 100 years, so i guess they have learned a thing or two.</p>
