<p><strong>Strong Brewed Coffee Cooled</strong>. For many people, a regular strength cup of coffee isn’t enough — they want big, bold flavor from their brew. Then combine these two ingredients in your coffee maker, and brew for about 4 minutes. Coffee brewed slowly in cold water is less acidic than hot brewed. 1/3 cup (75 ml) sugar.</p>

<p>For most people, it only takes about ten minutes to brew, or even just the touch of a button for those of us with machines. A typical strong cup of coffee uses 1 unit of coffee for 16 units of water, measured by weight. On the other hand, you brew iced coffee like any hot coffee. Iced coffee is brewed coffee that has been cooled down so it can be poured over ice. Cold brewing is a brilliant method of extracting flavor from coffee grounds very gradually which results in a milder yet more coffee. ½ cup (125 ml) chocolate syrup.</p>
