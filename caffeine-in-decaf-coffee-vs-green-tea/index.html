<p><strong>Caffeine In Decaf Coffee Vs Green Tea</strong>. Green tea contains many nutrients that have been linked with considerable health benefits. A typical cup of oolong has ~50% the caffeine of a cup of black tea. The same amount of black tea has 40 to 60 milligrams, while green tea has just 15 milligrams. Green tea has a third of the amount of caffeine that coffee does (about 30 milligrams versus 96), but it’s still to be avoided in the evening, namely in the couple of hours before you hit the hay.</p>

<p>While green tea and coffee both have caffeine, coffee has significantly more. Green tea has between 30 to 50 mg of caffeine in an eight ounce cup. If you are looking for a 100% caffeine free drink, you need to use the term caffeine free and not decaffeinated. For comparison, stash green tea has 16 mg of caffeine after 1 minute of steeping under the same conditions. They contain half the amount of caffeine than what present in unblended tea. The same amount of black tea has 40 to 60 milligrams, while green tea has just 15 milligrams.</p>
