<p><strong>What Is A Pour Over Coffee Pot</strong>. To be fair, top dollar drip coffee brewers can make a great cup of coffee that rivals pour over coffee, but unless you’re willing to spend $200+, that’s not going to happen. Pour over and drip are similar in that they both involve a slow flow of water through coffee grounds, but the key difference is that the former is done by hand, which leads to a more thorough saturation of the grounds. The method entails putting coffee grounds into a carafe, pouring in hot water, letting it steep, and then pushing down a plunger to separate the brewed coffee for drinking. The pour over coffee method is arguably the cleanest and purest way to make and drink coffee.</p>
