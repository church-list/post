<p><strong>Irish Whiskey Coffee Drinks</strong>. Irish whiskey is smooth and creates impressive drinks. The combination of a smooth irish whiskey with rich black coffee that�s sweetened and topped with cream is an absolute delight. 1 jigger irish whiskey (1 1/2 ounces or 3 tablespoons) heavy cream, slightly whipped Whiskey, or the literal translation from the original irish name “water of life” (uisce beatha), is one of the most famous irish drinks, and rightly so because it has a smooth finish due to the fact that most brands don’t use peat (connemara is an exception).</p>

<p>Combining coffee with irish whiskey, brown sugar and lightly whipped cream, the irish coffee is a hot, creamy classic that can wake you up on cold mornings or keep you going after a long night. A recipe unchanged since 1888. First cold, thick cream and perhaps the scent of nutmeg, then hot, sweet coffee, and finally the gentle warmth of irish whiskey. The addition of irish whiskey to piping hot coffee makes a winter warmer much different than your morning cup of joe. 1 cup freshly brewed hot coffee. Slane�s take on the classic irish coffee.</p>

<p>You’ll find everything from stout and coffee to whiskey and more. Mixed to perfection with aged irish whiskey. You’ll never look at irish whiskey—or coffee—the same way again.

It calls for irish whiskey, brown sugar for rich sweetness, coffee and freshly whipped cream. While there are tried and true favorites like the irish coffee, irish whiskey is surprisingly versatile.</p>
