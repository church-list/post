<p><strong>Coffee And Cortisol Post Workout</strong>. Many people consume coffee as a way to improve energy, mental focus, alertness and wakefulness in the morning. That feeding is flipping the switch in your body from a catabolic to an anabolic state. If a recent study from mcmaster�s university is to be believed, the opposite might be true. Research has shown that patients receiving 3 grams of vitamin c per day experience lower cortisol levels (peters, anderson &amp; theron, 2001).</p>

<p>This is partly why we experience a wonderful but temporary and unsustainable burst of energy. Cortisol is the major stress hormone in the body and it is primarily secreted in large amounts during times of stress (4). A second line of defense? Protein=a much better fuel source pre (and post) workout over coffee any day. The release of cortisol triggers changes to the way that your body metabolizes glucose, how much energy your muscles burn and your tolerance to stress. Cold coffee smoothies post workout rule i like cold coffee with some espresso powder, 5 or 6 ice cubes, chocolate whey, water, maybe a bit of cinnamon.</p>
