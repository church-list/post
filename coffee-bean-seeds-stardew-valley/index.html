<p>Coffee beans grow and mature 10 days after being planted (and every 2 days thereafter) in either spring or summer. No single coffee bean sold so far. Coffee plants will last spring and summer, and it�s spring 5, so you�ll get a lot of coffee beans really early. Stardew valley proves to be an addicting game to pick up and can be unforgiving at times. Because they can be purchased in advance of fall, they can stock up rather easily. Other crops like the ancient fruit are more profitable but coffee is easy to cultivate.</p>

<p>Spring is the season the game always starts in and acts as a good way to measure the coming year�s productivity. Cranberries offer up the best cost/time/sell ratio for the fall. Coffee plants will last spring and summer, and it�s spring 5, so you�ll get a lot of coffee beans really early. Stardew valley best crops spring strawberries. Again, personally i�d buy it. Time spent waiting for something to happen is time to reflect on the pastoral sereneness of your surroundings.</p>
