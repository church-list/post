<p>The aeropress brew method also offers a lot more control and flexibility than the nespresso. You want to use a medium grind. Aim for a coffee mug whose top is bigger than the aeropress with the cap on, since balancing it on top of a smaller coffee mug ends up with lots of drips and mess. It is $2 more expensive than the original, but just go for the aeropress go if you’re deciding between the two. Then there are my brew methods/coffee taste/experience: Dump grounds, slowly pour water to top of 2.</p>

<p>You can still make the original aeropress recipe for 4 ounces of concentrated coffee (which can be diluted), but some other recipes for brewing a standard cup of coffee will need to be modified. Sure, it wasn’t quite good enough to book my ticket to dublin for the world championship, but it’s surprisingly versatile and pretty simple. Many coffee aficionados claim that this is the superior way to do aeropress. Many people use the aeropress as a method of making a crude espresso, eliminating the need to go out and buy an expensive machine to do so. You can get about 8 fl oz of coffee with the inverted method, and just under 10 fl oz with tthatlar brewing method. After 1 min, place aeropress right side up over cup/mug.</p>
