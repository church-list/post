<p><strong>Can Coffee Stunt Your Growth</strong>. No need to answer the question on whether or not its bad for you. And apparently, it’s a pretty common one. There is a myth about caffeine and coffee that it stunts your growth. You don�t really need to drink anything but water the thing is coffee makes you dehydrated and so you think dam i am tired i need some coffee to wake me up a gen ( coffee takes so much out of you that you need to drink 8 cups of water to put it back in you body ) so what do you do you go and get a norther coffee then you get more dehydrated so you get more.</p>

<p>It is not to say that this is a neglected side of research, but even just the studies around it have not yet found a reason to believe that. I recently heard someone say this? What can stunt your growth? Can 12 year olds drink coffee? This idea may have come from the misconception that coffee causes osteoporosis (a condition that may be associated with loss of height).

<p>It never has, and it never will. Plus, coffee is not the only drink or food that has caffeine in it. This idea may have come from the misconception that coffee causes osteoporosis (a condition that may be associated with loss of height). For most people, a cup or two of coffee a day doesn�t do any harm. If you’re looking for proof that coffee doesn’t stunt your growth, just take a look at our founder danny — he’s about 6’8 and drinks multiple cups of coffee every single day! But coffee does contain caffeine.</p>
