<p>Over ice brew ™ the ninja coffee bar will beep to signal a completed place the vessel that you would like to brew into brew. It�s a special process to do, more than just running the clean cycle. It shuts down automatically after about 30 seconds. This feature is beneficial for those of you who cannot find the time to perform regular maintenance on your coffee machine. If the clean light keeps coming on, then you might need to clean your coffee maker (doh!). Stir to cool coffee completely.</p>

<p>Cleaning light won�t go off. Once your machine has finished cleaning, the clean light should turn off. I have had the ninja coffee bar system just over a year, cleaned it every two weeks, it was great, one day it just quit working, (after the year), made a lot of steam but very little coffee, you. But something that a lot of you ninja coffee bar owners and i struggled with, was that the pesky “clean” light would stay off for a split second, but then it would come back on and stay on. If the clean light keeps coming on, then you might need to clean your coffee maker (doh!). Won’t even brew a cup.</p>
