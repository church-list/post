<p>1 tablespoon of ghee butter. If you’re like me and only drink your coffee with cream and sugar then you might appreciate this cinnamon coconut bulletproof coffee recipe. As you will see in the recipe card below, my personal favorite way of making bulletproof coffee is 16 ounces of strong brewed coffee + 1 tablespoon coconut oil + 2 scoops beef gelatin (or marine collagen…i go both ways). I don’t typically use ghee, unless i make it myself. The bulletproof coffee brand is known for making coffee with butter. I am a fan of coffee i just usually don’t like what people put in it (sugar, dairy, artificial sweeteners, etc).</p>
