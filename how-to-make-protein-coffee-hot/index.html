<p>For example, adding vanilla whey protein isolate to my instant coffee tastes like french vanilla. I definitely had to perfect this and make it a few times to get it right. Using a whisk, add cinnamon and protein powder and thoroughly combine. If you want a hot protein drink using coffee (a very delicious combo): Mix the protein so that it is liquid at room temperature (only use enough liquid to dissolve the protein) slowly add the coffee to the mixture until the mix is the right balance; Supplement manufacturers appealed to our tastes buds and have produced a variety of different flavors of whey protein.</p>

<p>Problem is, protein powder doesn’t play nice with hot coffee. I went forward anyway and added met warm black coffee. Make sure you remove the plastic insert in the cover so that steam can escape. Coffee is the only thing i put in my body (besides water) before 9 am. So for me, it’s better to combine coffee and protein powder into one drink. I just have to get more protein in and am trying to change from bullitt proof coffee which i love.</p>
