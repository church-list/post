<p><strong>Does Coffee Give You Energy In The Morning</strong>. If your daily cups of coffee help you to feel better, you might temporarily feel somewhat low and depressed without them. Posted by simonetta rossill september 24, 2015.

<p>If your daily cups of coffee help you to feel better, you might temporarily feel somewhat low and depressed without them.

So you can be both stimulated and energized by coffee. Coffee is one of the best sources of caffeine on the planet. Coffee increases energy levels because it contains caffeine which is a stimulant. Consumption of 3 milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of body weight (about one to one and a half cups of brewed coffee) appears not to produce some of the energizing effects, and as much as 6 mg/kg may be needed.</p>
