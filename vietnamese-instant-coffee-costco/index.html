<p>Millions of fans carry g7 coffee with them for a delicious cup anytime they need it. The traditional way of making a vietnamese coffee is by using a special vietnamese coffee filter, called a phin.it’s a cheap and flimsy contraption made of aluminium, easily found at most asian grocery stores, but i have also seen more fancy and upmarket stainless steel versions sold in some specialty stores. Odds are, you didn’t picture your coffee plantation in vietnam, but maybe you should have. A wide variety of vietnam instant coffee options are available to you, such as sugar, chocolate, and cream. 4,319 vietnam instant coffee products are offered for sale by suppliers on alibaba.com, of which instant coffee accounts for 43%, ground coffee accounts for 1%, and arabica coffee beans accounts for 1%. Using a phin creates a stronger brew than the traditional american drip machine.</p>
