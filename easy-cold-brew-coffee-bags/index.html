<p>This freshly roasted cold brew coffee is rich, pleasantly smooth and tipped with dark chocolate and nutty coffee notes. I’ve spent a lot of time streamlining the process and perfecting my brew, so i’m really excited to pass my morning coffee routine along to you. The perfect batch of cold brew coffee without the hassle, mess or high price. If you can fund the sweet spot between grind size and fabric quality, the water will be able to get to the grounds, absorb the flavor, and you just pull the bag out. Overall, tea bag coffee provides many benefits as a method to have your coffee. Add 4 cups of cold, filtered water.</p>
