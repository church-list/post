<p>Coffee air freshener for your car and home: Aside from giving us a daily boost, coffee also works as a natural homemade air freshener. First thing first, you will need several paper bags like this one. Simply load it up with coffee grounds, tie it together with a ribbon, then hang it anywhere you want the fresh scent of coffee. To use coffee grounds as an air freshener, let them dry out (an important step to avoid mold) before transferring to a bowl or wrapping in an old stocking that you’ll place in an. Fold the opening two to three times (a, b, c) and punch a hole in the center.</p>

<p>Coffee can be a bit on the expensive side. Fill your car, your home or even your closets with that wonderful aroma by making your own air fresheners with coffee and decorative cotton fabric. If you cannot function without coffee in your life, then i have an amazingly simple and powerful air freshener instructable for you. Then punch a couple more holes on the paper bags (d). My personal favorite is grinding them coarsely, like you would for french press coffee, and then adding water to fill the pan. Not only does coffee have one of the best smells ever but coffee grounds help absorb stinky areas.</p>
