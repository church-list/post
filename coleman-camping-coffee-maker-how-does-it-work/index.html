<p>Like the coleman it is a full camping coffee system that will take you from cold grounds to a blissful brew in just two minutes using its patented fluxring cook top. Coleman quikpot propane coffee maker. Makes a good pot of coffee. I suppose a down side may be that it doesn�t have a warming plate, but warming plates cause the coffee to evaporate and get bitter, so having to. Coleman�s description makes it sound like it will only work on one of their camp stoves, but i just used this coffee maker on a motorhome stove on a trip from ohio to alaska and it worked perfectly. This one takes up even more space though due to its propane adapter and subsequent propane bottle.</p>

It’s convenient to use that it can fit in many stove burners.

Again, this is one of the larger coffee makers on our list, but when you can’t leave the kitchen behind, this is the one you bring. I suppose a down side may be that it doesn�t have a warming plate, but warming plates cause the coffee to evaporate and get bitter, so having to.</p>
