<p><strong>Rug Under Coffee Table Size</strong>. This usually means the rug needs to be around 120cm wider than the table to allow an extra 60cm width on each side. With this layout, the rug should extend at least six inches past each piece of furniture. When choosing a new coffee table, it�s important to measure your existing living room furniture using a tape measure before you begin. There�s no denying the power of a great rug.</p>

<p>Best outdoor rugs that last Depending upon the size of your coffee table and accompanying furniture, choose a rug that accommodates all 4 legs of the table. A small area rug positioned beneath the coffee table can be charming. The rug should extend at least 24, and no more than 36, beyond all sides of the table, so chairs can sit on a flat surface, even when they are pushed back. I have a 4 x 8 pool table and want to put a rug underneath it. Can the table go smaller and you do have a entrance door there to that kinda close.</p>
