<p><strong>Is Coffee Bad For Dogs To Drink</strong>. A stimulant to the central nervous system, a veterinary visit is essential if your pet consumes caffeine. If you left coffee laying around the house, in most cases they would drink it, or even eat the beans or crushed down grinds for instant coffee. Can dogs drink tea or coffee? Dogs and cats are more sensitive to caffeine than we are.</p>

<p>Coffee isn�t good for dogs, however according to my vet, my 11 1/2 pound bichonpoo would have to drink 8 to 12 ounces before it is toxic. There is caffine in coffee and in any case why are you giving your dog things that are not healthy. I take my dog with me regularly to a meeting. But the answer to this question is easy… dogs should never have coffee. Pets are more sensitive to the effects of caffeine than people are. Stop giving your dog coffee, rather get treats or something, but water is best for all dogs.</p>

<p>Aside from hydration, the vet may induce vomiting or give activated charcoal. Generally, it’s unlikely that a small amount of coffee will hurt your dog. Both tea and coffee contain caffeine which can result in a dog suffering from caffeine poisoning. How much is too much depends on many factors, such as the size of your pets and whether your dog only lapped the coffee or actually ingested coffee grounds, which contain a much higher amount of caffeine. The reason is that the vet may be able to stop the absorption of the caffeine. Giving your leftover tea to your dog sounds harmless enough, but caffeine can be toxic to dogs.</p>
