<p><strong>Kona Coffee Hawaii Lion</strong>. To encourage the youth of hawaii to attend college there are a large number of incentive programs some even sponsored by my favorite lion beans. In a bowl, combine the lion kona coffee, brown sugar, smoked paprika, chili powder, ginger, vanilla bean seeds, salt and black pepper.rub spice mixture all over the beef, coating evenly. The rich volcanic soil drains well and is packed with minerals. These big, flavorful kona coffee beans are expertly roasted to produce a consistent and truly gourmet coffee when brewed.</p>
