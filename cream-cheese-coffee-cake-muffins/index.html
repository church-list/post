<p>This cake was originally a regular coffee cake by ina garten made with sour cream and then maria over at two peas and their pod made it into a coffee cake using greek. Divide among 12 to 14 muffin cups. And i made it a mission to come up with a muffin even i would choose first. Bake 20 to 25 minutes. Using a pastry cutter (or two knives) cut 4 tablespoons cold butter into mixture. The sour cream i use in these coffee cake muffins makes them fairly rich, but super tender.</p>

<p>Line a muffin tin with paper liners and set aside. This easy coffee cake is moist, and buttery, topped with cinnamon filling, vanilla cheesecake, and a sweet streusel topping. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Raspberry cream cheese sweet rolls. This makes 8 large muffins, but you could certainly make them smaller to get 12. June 01/25/2014 at 20:51 reply.</p>
