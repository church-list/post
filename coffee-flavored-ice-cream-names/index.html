<p>It no longer has 10% milk fat required to call a product ice cream. breyers coffee stuff only has 3 grams of fat. Vanilla, chocolate and strawberry are still ice cream. check their labels when buying. I serve it plain, just scooped into a dessert dish, so the mild, creamy coffee flavor can be enjoyed to the fullest. If a mere 31 flavors just doesn’t whet your appetite, try these 401 creamy treats: These are the 401 most catchy ice cream shop names ever created.
