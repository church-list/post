<p><strong>Best Way To Brew Coffee In A French Press</strong>. Very few brews hit the spot like a french press, but getting it right is a fine art. While there are many ways of making cold brew, one of the most straightforward ways is the french press cold brew. One great way to ruin that niceness would be to violently agitate your coffee grounds, accelerating extraction right at the end when your coffee has already given up the good stuff and the bitter and astringent negative flavors are in danger of taking over. Buy some beans, grind them, add hot water to your coffee grounds, press the plunger down, and that is pretty much that.</p>

<p>But the surefire way to ruin your french press coffee is to steep it for too long; It�s one of the few brewing methods that allows all the natural oils and proteins in the grounds to be present in the final cup. Discard hot water and place the french press on your scale. Because french press is an immersion brew method (meaning the coffee is completely submerged in water and stays in contact until the brewing is done), you want a very chunky, coarse grind size. Easy to brew and super consistent, the french press is very reliable. The first step to fabulous french press coffee is to warm up the press.</p>
