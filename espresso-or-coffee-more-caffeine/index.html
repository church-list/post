<p>Most coffee recipes call for about 30 grams coffee per 12 to 16 ounces water. Using more coffee than that will also increase the caffeine level in your coffee. However, when you get down to numbers the amount of caffeine is greater in a drip cup of coffee. Most people say that espresso is more caffeinated.

From a beverage perspective, since espresso is served in much smaller volumes, we get less caffeine. Similarly, if you brew your coffee with more ground beans per cup of water, there will be more caffeine in the brew. So actually there is more caffeine in an average cup of drip coffee than in espresso. However, it’s not accurate to compare caffeine levels per serving because there’s such a huge difference between the size of an espresso shot and a cup of coffee — a cup of drip brew can vary from 8 ounces to over 30.</p>
