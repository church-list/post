<p><strong>Less Acidic Coffee Alternative</strong>. I went from coffee to black tea to decaf black tea to nothing, and am now back to drinking decaf tea. The acidity is from the caffeine content, not the coffee itself. Sugar (optional) or preferably another low glycemic sweetener (stevia, raw honey) to brew the coffee, you will need an ibrik (a turkish coffee pot) if you have one or a saucepan. Roasted dandelion root contains probiotics which are being shown everyday to be critical for just about every part of the body.</p>

<p>It’s no secret that this roast makes people feel alert and well each morning — so much so that customers would write in asking why and how they could feel so good when coffee is known for its acidic reputation. From a ph standpoint, coffee is on the acidic side of the spectrum. Lo and behold, this coffee has 70% less acid than any other roasted coffee, and seven times the antioxidant level of green tea. I went from coffee to black tea to decaf black tea to nothing, and am now back to drinking decaf tea. One of the few disadvantages of cold brewing is that you also extract fewer antioxidants from it. If coffee acid bothers your stomach, try a french or italian roast coffee.</p>
<h3 id="when-we-have-consistent-sources-of-acidic-substances-in-our-system">When we have consistent sources of acidic substances in our system.</h3>
<p>The answer is no, you can drink the decaf coffee with acid reflux which is less acidic coffee or free of acid, where the most amount of caffeine has been removed to make it healthy. Nevertheless, it’s safe to say that cold brewing results in a smoother cup with lower perceived acidity, meaning that cold brew coffee overall tastes less acidic. It’s likely that a less acidic coffee (a darker roast coffee, typically), the more likely soy milk will be stable. Coffee is not as acidic as most other drinks. Even though cold brew coffee is often marketed as a much less acidic alternative to hot brewed coffee, there isn’t enough evidence to back up this claim. Coffee that is grown at low altitudes seems to be lower in acid than higher altitude coffees.</p>
