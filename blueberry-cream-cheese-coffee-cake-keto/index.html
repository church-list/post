<p>My first version was drizzled with a lemony cream cheese glaze — and while that was fire, it was an extra step i knew i wouldn’t always want to take. Blueberry coffee cake with cream cheese. This coffee cake has delicious layers of cake, cream cheese and cinnamon crumble topping. Scatter the blueberries over the cream cheese mixture. Mix well, and press into a greased 9″ baking dish. The first time i made this keto crumb cake, i just kinda winged it and prayed for the best.</p>

<p>Heat the cream cheese for 30 seconds in the microwave until soft. Slice the cream cheese into about 1/4″ slices, and lay on top of the cinnamon layer. I should probably call it keto cream cheese coffee cake bars, but the name was already long enough. This coffee cake is also low carb, sugar free, gluten free, keto friendly, and a trim healthy mama s fuel. Add the rest of the cake batter, top with remaining 1/2 cup blueberries and finally add the crumble over the top of the cake. I wanted it moist, hence the addition of sour cream.</p>
