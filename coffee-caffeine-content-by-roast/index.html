<p><strong>Coffee Caffeine Content By Roast</strong>. The truth, however, is that the roast of the coffee has little or no effect on the caffeine content since the compound remains very stable at the temperatures to which coffee. Thus, dark roast coffee contains more caffeine than light roast coffee. Weakly extracted coffee might yield 0.6% of its weight in caffeine and very strongly extracted coffee might get close to 1% caffeine. The only difference, and it’s a vague one, is that the coffee beans expand slightly during the roasting process.</p>

<p>Although this does have an impact on the caffeine content in the coffee bean, the coffee beans also get another flavor profile depending on the roast. Followed by arabica, which gives you about 95 mg of caffeine per average cup. The only thing that influences that is what kind of coffee bean you use, arabica or robusta. This listing is referring to coffee made using arabica coffee beans. In that time the temperature of the coffee will gradually rise. That is to say, 100g of a dark roast would be more coffee beans than 100g of a light roast, and will result in more caffeine in your cup.</p>
<h3 id="due-to-reduced-mass-and-smaller-size-the-number-of-dark-roast-beans-required-to-make-coffee-increases">Due to reduced mass and smaller size, the number of dark roast beans required to make coffee increases.</h3>
<p>Followed by arabica, which gives you about 95 mg of caffeine per average cup. Because they’ve been roasted longer, dark roasts have less mass. This roast level has less caffeine than the lighter roasts. Caffeine content varies by roast level, diminishing with increased roasting level: Liberica had the lowest caffeine concentration at 75 mg per average size cup. A study looking at the correlation between roast levels and caffeine content found the answer to be less than straightforward.</p>
