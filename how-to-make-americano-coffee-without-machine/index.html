<p>My favorite coffee drink is americano. Mix that into your coffee (like creamer) and it will add a sweet creamy taste to your americano. Equipment (making espresso without a coffee machine) there are literally hundreds of coffee gadgets out on the market with claims they can make espresso without the need of the traditional machine. Needless to say, to be enjoyable without sugar or milk, it needs to be nearly perfect.
