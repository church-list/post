<p><strong>Locally Roasted Organic Coffee Beans</strong>. Café don pablo’s subtle earth organic coffee is made with 100% pure arabica beans sourced from honduras, which give it a rich chocolaty flavor with hints of caramel and honey. Boasting 22 years of roasting experience, third coast coffee sources certified fair trade (and fair trade transitional), organic beans from small farming cooperatives throughout central and south america, africa, asia and indonesia and roasts them locally on a small batch basis. Coffee roasted right here in turks and caicos. We started roasting beans in 2012, and with help from our friends we were able to turn a piece of the old film exchange building in northwest portland into a cozy little spot to roast coffee and serve tasty beverages.</p>
