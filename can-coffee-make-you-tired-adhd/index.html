<p>It is extremely immature of those of you who think add/adhd is a hoax or is just an excuse to get pills. Caffeine can cause a racing adhd brain to grow more excitable and alert. You might get an alarm clock that jumps off the table, forcing you to chase it. Coffee is traditionally a method of boosting energy, but for many people, it can make them tired. When adhd meds wear off, there can be a dreaded crash which feels physically rough and can put you in a bad mood. I donÔøΩt know where you heard that.</p>

I never made an informed decision about my choice to √¢ ¬¶ so it stands to reason that kicking the habit could make you feel worse. Coffee doesnt make me tired, it just relaxes me.</p>
