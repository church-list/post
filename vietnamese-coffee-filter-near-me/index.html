<p><strong>Vietnamese Coffee Filter Near Me</strong>. Thanks to amazon, i was able to buy this real vietnamese ground coffee and sweetened condensed milk (yes, they�re distinctly different from their american counterparts). The coffee was brought out with a layer of condensed milk at the bottom of a small, clear thick glass, with a stainless steel phin vietnamese filter sitting on top. This intensely brewed concentrate is creamy, rich, smooth in texture, and has a bold flavor. In addition, vietnamese coffee is made of robusta beans, which contain more caffeine than other types of coffee.</p>
