<p><strong>Apple Cinnamon Coffee Cake No Sour Cream</strong>. Add half of the flour mixture to the wet ingredients and mix until combined. The taste of the final product was not affected as i have tested it with both, so use whichever you prefer. The apple filling i tweaked as well. In a separate small bowl, mix 2 tbsp of the sugar with the cinnamon, set aside.</p>
