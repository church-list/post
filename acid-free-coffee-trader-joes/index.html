<p><strong>Acid Free Coffee Trader Joes</strong>. Assuming a larger cup size and a more generous 3 grams per serving, this product costs approximately 9 cents per serving. Trader joe’s has a regular version of their french roast, but this product has been specifically developed for those who are looking for a low acid alternative. This range features a clever blend of 100% arabica coffees and flax seeds, which are alkaline (thereby neutralizing the coffee acids). The understated but brisk cup is marred by a dull, salty sensation that intensifies as the coffee cools.</p>
