Cacao theobroma (hereafter referred to as cacao)is the tropical tree that produces cocoa beans, which in turn are the source of chocolate, cocoa butter and cocoa powder. The seeds are spread in the sand and covered to keep them moist. Note that many professional coffee plantations prune trees to the ground every three years to encourage new growth. Cut or pinch away the growing tips of each stem to encourage lateral branching. On small plants, when it’s about 500mm (20″) tall prune off the growing tip to encourage lateral branching.</p>
