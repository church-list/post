<p>It takes a lot more care to cold brew your coffee in advance to achieve that same depth of flavor without being diluted against your taste. Slowly push down the lid of your french press, and pour your coffee in a cup over ice. Make sure these beans are fine enough to be infused well. Combine the ground coffee and water in the french press. Customize to your heart’s content. Add desired amount of ice.</p>

<p>The low acid prep makes the coffee naturally sweet. You can even make your concentrate stronger by adding more coffee to water in the french press. Pour one part coffee concentrate into a glass and add 1 part water. Collect 48g of coffee (roughly 9 tablespoons of beans) and set water to boil in a kettle. On my burr grinder, i grind right in between middle and fine. Customize to your heart’s content.</p>
