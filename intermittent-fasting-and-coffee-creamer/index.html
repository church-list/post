<p>I see you recommend heavy cream instead of half and half. Diet sodas containing xylitol or stevia are fine. Last week, lifeapps featured a live ama via our facebook messenger chatbot with our chemist zach lawton and our science communicator paige jarreau all about coffee and intermittent fasting! Mostly i follow 14:10 or 15:9 if. This is when things change a little bit. What about adding a little creamer to your coffee?</p>

<p>You‚Äôll need to keep the total calories under 50 so you can remain in a fasted state. I‚Äôve been eating lchf for about 6 weeks and lost around 26 pounds which obviously i‚Äôm very happy with. I have a question here. Still, you‚Äôll want to moderate your intake and avoid most additives like sugar or milk. It will not only keep you hydrated, but it can also help curb hunger while fasting without putting you at risk of ruining it ( 9) ( 10 ). If cream in your coffee makes it easier for you to stretch out the time between meals, then it is helping, not hurting.</p>
