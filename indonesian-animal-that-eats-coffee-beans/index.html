<p>The beans are (ahem) expelled through their feces intact. I wish i knew the full story on the first guy that decided to try brewing coffee from these beans, but sadly that story has been lost to the sands of time. The cherries are fermented as they pass through a civet�s intestines, and after being defecated with other fecal matter, they are collected. So basically, a cat called the asian palm civet eats the berries from a coffee tree, then basically poops them out. This is the reason kopi luwak is often called “cat poop” coffee. According to producers of animal luwak coffee, the beans improve through two.</p>
