<p><strong>Butter Pecan Coffee Cake Recipe</strong>. She will be home next week from college for the holiday and requested one for brunch. In the large bowl of an electric mixer, cream the 3/4 cup (1 1/2) sticks of butter. Simply melt butter, brown sugar, buttermilk, salt, and chopped pecans. Some things are just not okay to buy from the grocery store, and packaged crumb cake is one of them.</p>

<p>In a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer), cream the butter until smooth. Drizzle over warm coffee cake. Btw, this was a staple of my childhood sunday brunches along with bagels, schmear and nova. This beautiful bundt cake combines the flavors of butter, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and pecans. Top with remaining cake layer, and frost top and sides of cake with remaining frosting. Step 1, preheat the oven to 350 degrees f.</p>

<p>Instructions to make the filling and topping: Some things are just not okay to buy from the grocery store, and packaged crumb cake is one of them. Tulip baking papers are made from parchment paper and are taller than regular baking cups. Spread evenly with 1 heaping cup of frosting. Beat in the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Step 1, preheat the oven to 350 degrees f.</p>
