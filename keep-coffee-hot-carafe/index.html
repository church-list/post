<p><strong>Keep Coffee Hot Carafe</strong>. Getting a coffee maker with a thermal carafe included saves you the cost and hassle of buying another vessel. However, some are made from hard metals and while they keep your coffee warm on the inside, the outside of the mug may also get pretty hot and can be uncomfortable to hold. However, hot coffee does not last too long. The problem with this is that almost all of the best automatic drip coffee makers utilize a hot plate underneath the glass carafe.</p>
