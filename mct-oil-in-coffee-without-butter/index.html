<p>But the mct is more expensive than coconut oil, and i actually prefer the taste of the bulletproof style butter coffee with coconut oil over mct. ‘based on scientific evidence, butter is not dangerous, but neither is it particularly nutritious,’ says dr harcombe, who is an expert in public health dietary guidelines.‘so bulletproof coffee isn’t unsafe, but i’d still urge caution. You have a choice with this one. Keto coffee bombs, or bulletproof coffee is intended to be drunk first thing in the morning in place of food for breakfast. Mct oil is the last ingredient in the official bulletproof concoction, and that’s the one that i skip altogether.

<p>Bulletproof coffee is coffee made with either butter or ghee, and either coconut oil or mct oil. If you end up liking the mct oil, you can always increase it to 1 tbsp.

Bulletproof coffee is, essentially, a hot coffee, plus two tablespoons of butter, plus a tablespoon of mct oil (that�s medium chain triglyceride oil, which we�ll talk more about in a minute). Composition of mct oil varies.</p>
