<p><strong>Dogs And Coffee Beans</strong>. There is no difference between eating coffee beans and coffee grounds, except that coffee beans are usually very hard and if your dog ingests a big amount of them, they could be suffering from gastrointestinal blockage. Most varieties of beans contain “lectins”, a type of protein that can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea in dogs, but cooking can destroy this protein. In addition, this depends on whether they ate any coffee grounds, the type of coffee beans that were used (many of which contain higher concentrations of caffeine), and the method in which the coffee was brewed. You need to know that decaf coffee isn’t completely free of caffeine.</p>
