<p><strong>Is Decaf Coffee Safe While Breastfeeding</strong>. My question is, has anyone noticed any problems with lo while drinking decaf through out the day? For example, a 16 ounce, grande cup of starbucks decaf coffee has 25 mg of caffeine while a 16 ounce, grande cup of starbucks blonde roast has 360 mg of caffeine. Yes, it is perfectly safe to have caffeine when you�re breastfeeding. When caffeine enters your bloodstream, a small amount of it (usually less than 1 percent) ends up in your breast milk.</p>

Just like regular coffee, decaffeinated coffee contains antioxidants, but about fifteen percent may be lost during the decaffeination process.
