<p>Blend between comedy and serious moments were spot on. Fast paced romance, male chases female first, adapted from a manga, obsessive male lead, older man/younger woman, shy female lead, clingy male lead, first love, weak female lead, rich male lead; I love the chemistry between the two and they absolutely show a healthy relationship. Read your favorite manga online! Do you want to discuss the manga “coffee &amp; vanilla black” or do you simply have a question about it? Naruto manga, bleach manga, one piece manga, air gear manga, claymore manga, fairy tail manga, inuyasha manga, and many more.</p>

<p>To fully enjoy this manga, you need to temporarily suspend belief and remember that these characters live in a perfect utopian society and literally have. Coffee &amp; vanilla has beautifully drawn characters but so far, the plot is a bit gushy. Many manga works are full of extreme characters and situations that, when adapted to live drama, can leave a bad taste to some viewers. Love at first site maybe real, but in real life there should still be a development and not just two characters. Naruto manga, bleach manga, one piece manga, air gear manga, claymore manga, fairy tail manga, inuyasha manga, and many more. Blend between comedy and serious moments were spot on.</p>
