<p>You can try using your regular milk in place of creamer. It’s reasonably priced at $4.99 a package, but if you’re even a little bit of a coffee snob, you’ll want to leave it on the shelf. Salt (salted caramel) this is an aldi find at my store in metro detroit, but have heard other nerds say they have this as a regular item item (in different flavors!!) at their aldi! Aldi brand for the win. If your goal is weight loss, then your coffee creamer should not contain trans fats, artificial chemicals, excessive sugar, or fillers such as carrageenan. I love adding flavor to my coffee from time to time with creamer, but after reading the label on some of these products, i stopped buying them even though there are a bunch of interesting flavors out there.</p>

<p>Aldi always has fun seasonal finds! It contains real milk and cream while leaving out the artificial ingredients. Looking for a healthy coffee creamer that still gives you the creaminess of real milk? But if this one isn�t available then coffee mate caramel mach is an okay subtitute. Coffee capsules (7) fewer options sort by: Aldi has most keto staples you need including high quality fats.</p>
