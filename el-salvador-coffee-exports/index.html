<p><strong>El Salvador Coffee Exports</strong>. Coffee exports, once the backbone of el salvador�s economy, have fallen by more than half in the last 10 years, according to the salvadoran coffee council. Introduced in the late 1880’s, coffee quickly displaced indigo as the country’s chief export, and by the 1920s, coffee accounted for 90% of all el salvador’s exports. This perspective has lead to an unfortunate misrepresentation in the specialty coffee scene. This means that average coffee consumption in el salvador per capita is around 2.8kg, which is medium to high among latin american producing countries.</p>
