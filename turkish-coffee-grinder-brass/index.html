<p>Here is the ultimate buying guide for the best hand grinder for turkish coffee. Many of them claim that it will grind coffee beans but they can only grind spices. Turkish coffee requires the coffee beans to ground very finely, more so than any other type of coffee. This coffee grinder has an oblong design. The grind is relatively smooth and the grinder is ergonomic, making for a comparatively easy grind. Even though these machines get the work done, they do this quite loudly, just in massive batches, and may make your friends wonder whether they are supposed to trick.</p>
