<p><strong>Bulletproof Coffee With Ghee And Collagen</strong>. Ghee is also known as a type of clarified butter. I love fourth &amp; heart ghee because it is smoother than butter, and i argue it’s even better ? This keto bulletproof coffee recipe is a boost of healthy fats your body needs. Ghee falls onto the green side of oils and fats on the bulletproof® diet.</p>

<p>The vanilla ghee adds a sweet richness to the coffee without any added sugars, and the coconut and vanilla collagen coupled with the cinnamon makes me feel like i�m drinking fancy coffee from a cafe. A coffee with additional smoothness and deliciousness. Ghee also has a higher smoke rate than butter so can be a more bulletproof cooking oil. I only use 1/2 scoop collagen now because i was finding it was making the bulletproof a little grainy/chalky tasting with a full scoop. Supercharged bulletproof coffee serves 2 ingredients. This recipe is your favorite bulletproof coffee blended with greek yogurt, collagen, and ice.</p>
