<p><strong>Coffee Ice Cream Recipe No Churn</strong>. 3/4 cup sweetened condensed milk. The science behind these recipes has been tinkered with to eliminate the churning process, meaning they’re not quite like the traditional custard recipes you may be accustomed to. There are lots of recipes for this style of ice cream, but this one comes from nigella lawson (you know, that buxom, british. Because it measures the same as sugar it’s the perfect swap to make all my favorite recipes better.</p>

<p>The great thing about this ice cream is that it’s no churn and takes minutes to put together. It only takes a few ingredients, a hand mixer, and a freezer. Combine espresso mixture, condensed milk, chocolate, vanilla extract, and salt in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. This is another no churn ice cream recipe (i have lots right here) and the method is foolproof. Whisk together the condensed milk, vanilla and salt in a large bowl; 1/3 cup jarred dulce de leche, plus more for topping</p>

<p>I absolutely love to make ice cream. No ice cream churn required! Combine the condensed milk and coffee, and then mix it into the whipped cream. No fancy ice cream machine is required, so no need to drag out that bulky equipment. Because it measures the same as sugar it’s the perfect swap to make all my favorite recipes better. I absolutely love to make ice cream.</p>
