<p><strong>Perfect Cup Of Coffee Temperature</strong>. The flavour of a cup of coffee is determined by the level to which the water extracts the chemicals from the ground beans, a process that is largely influenced by the grinding process, temperatures, roast profile, brew time, and pressure. Coffee machine and walk away, it likely won’t produce the results you’re looking for. This is just under boiling and is the point at which most flavour compounds easily dissolve in water. Coffee’s notes shine between 120°f and 140°f, which is why we prefer this temperature.</p>

<p>Coffee’s notes shine between 120°f and 140°f, which is why we prefer this temperature. If you must, you can use a thermometer to see when your cup of coffee is within this range. The flavour of a cup of coffee is determined by the level to which the water extracts the chemicals from the ground beans, a process that is largely influenced by the grinding process, temperatures, roast profile, brew time, and pressure. For your regular cup of coffee, go for 175ºf, but if you buy some really good coffee beans and want to really taste the coffee and discover all of its flavor notes and qualities, serve it at 150ºf or lower. The perfect cup of coffee has just the right flavor, the right acidity level and the best aroma there is. Want the best possible cup of coffee?</p>
