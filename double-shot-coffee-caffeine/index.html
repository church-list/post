<p><strong>Double Shot Coffee Caffeine</strong>. Coffee shop menus have expanded and developed rapidly over the years and now there are many kinds of coffee drinks to choose from. You can directly measure the caffeine content by the ratio of your coffee in grams and water in milliliters. To figure this out, i found the average amount of caffeine per espresso shot, which, according to kicking horse coffee, is about 80mg of caffeine per double shot, meaning there’s about 40mg of caffeine per single shot of espresso. The caffeine content of espresso can vary considerably, but a good rule of thumb is to assume around 75mg for a single espresso shot and 150mg for a double espresso shot.</p>
