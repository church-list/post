<p><strong>Blueberry Cream Cheese Coffee Cake In A Bundt Pan</strong>. If this recipe has one downfall, it’s that one piece of coffee cake is definitely not enough. In a bowl or food processor (no need to wash from step 2), beat with an electric mixer on high speed or whirl cream cheese, remaining 1/4 cup sugar, remaining egg, and lemon juice until smooth. Fresh blueberries are perfect of course, but frozen work just as well. Combine 1 cup flour, baking powder and salt;</p>
