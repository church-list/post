<p>Perhaps the most prominent of these is that they could do a certain amount of damage to your drain and pipes. Maybe you ran out of toilet paper and used paper towels in desperation. As the grease builds up in the drain, other substances can get stuck in it. Instead, compost coffee grounds or use them in your next diy project. You probably make a pot of coffee before you leave for work, and if it�s your day to do it at the office, you�re probably making another pot there before noon. After you brew a pot of joe, don�t toss the grounds down the sink.</p>

<p>Coffee grounds are compost, put it in your garden and watch your flowers grow. Save yourself an expensive plumber bill and don’t dispose of coffee grounds down the sink drain. Peel eggs over a bin away from the sink and when washing out a cafetiere, use a sieve to gather up all the coffee grounds before throwing them away. (although, if the sink at work backs up you can always blame kim from hr.) This aside, coffee grounds, en masse, have a pretty good reputation for clogging drains. Disposing of used motor oil in your kitchen sink can pollute the environment and in some places, it�s also illegal to do so.</p>
