<p>Generally, the term mocha refers to any coffee with chocolate flavoring. A cafe mocha or mocha is a variant of a caffe latte, but a portion of chocolate is added, usually in the type of chocolate syrup. As cited by starbucks, the name came from the mocha city of yemen, which was one of the biggest centers of early coffee trade. This is done by adding chocolate powder or syrup to a shot of espresso, topping it with steamed milk and sometimes served with whipped cream. Coffee milk is equivalent to chocolate milk but coffee syrup is used instead. Chocolate and caramel are two of the greatest flavors, so i love the combination.</p>
