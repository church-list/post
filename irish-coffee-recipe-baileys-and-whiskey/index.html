<p>It is simple, refreshing, and flavorful. Baileys irish coffee is my drink of choice for a cold damp night. The origins of irish coffee date back to 1943 when a chef named joe sheridan added irish whiskey to the coffees of a group of freezing travelers in an effort to warm them up. Pour away the water and add a measure of irish whiskey and 1 teaspoon dark muscovado sugar to each glass. Make up the fresh coffee. Gently float the cream on the top and sprinkle the nutmeg over the cream.</p>
