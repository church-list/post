<p><strong>Growing Mushrooms In Coffee Grounds In A Jar</strong>. Growing mushrooms in coffee grounds. Used coffee grounds, mushroom spawn with sawdust (oyster or shiitake), a bucket/container of 2 to 5 gallon in size, spray bottle and cellophane. By definition, mushrooms are fungi, and therefore will grow in any type of environment that contains waste. Spores can be difficult to locate and growing mushrooms in this manner takes a bit longer than regrowing mushroom ends.</p>

Hence, they will provide adequate moisture levels for growing shrooms. Spray your mushrooms less if you notice mold growing on your coffee grounds.</p>
