<p><strong>Intermittent Fasting Coffee With Coconut Milk</strong>. Discussion of results regarding coffee and intermittent fasting. Most fasting experts would tell you that any type of calories will break your fast and that you need to take your coffee black.

Intermittent fasting is quite an efficient way for weight loss and also boosting your health but it does come with certain precautions. While coconut and almond milk may have fewer carbs, they do have calories and should also be avoided. I know that’s a ton of information to digest, but the rewards of intermittent fasting really are so beneficial. Does coconut milk break the intermittent fasting? Go ahead and put that milk in your coffee, y�all.</p>
