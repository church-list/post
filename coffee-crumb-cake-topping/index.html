<p><strong>Coffee Crumb Cake Topping</strong>. Besides gracing traditional crumb cake, it’s an incredibly versatile recipe to have on hand for whenever you’re making quick breads, snack cakes, fruit crisps, etc. Cut the coffee cake into squares while it�s still warm. A lot of coffee cakes include nuts in the crumb topping as well, which you could do here if you like that! Instead of being frosted, it’s usually topped with a streusel or crumb topping.</p>
