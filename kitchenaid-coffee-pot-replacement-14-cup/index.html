<p><strong>Kitchenaid Coffee Pot Replacement 14 Cup</strong>. Target / kitchen &amp; dining / kitchenaid replacement coffee carafe (209). Purchased as a replacement for the carafe that came with our kitchenaid 14 cup coffee maker (kcm222cu), which has a flat pouring spout. This resulted in having a very unhappy husband first thing in the morning, as the coffee was consistently spilled on the counter and floor, regardless of how slow you poured your coffee. Next time i buy filters, i will try the bigger filters, for commercial makers.</p>
