<p>If you measure your coffee by weight, this light roast will provide less caffeine than dark roasts because of its larger mass, leaving you to use fewer beans.

Kicking horse explains that if you measure your coffee by the scoop, light roast coffee will have more caffeine. The more traditional thinking is that lighter roasts have more caffeine. Light roasts have a toasted grain taste and pronounced acidity.</p>
