<p><strong>Bulletproof Coffee With Ghee And Mct Oil</strong>. But is it really healthy?. This keto butter coffee recipe is a satisfying, frothy &amp; creamy cup of coffee, perfect to have in the morning. I find it unnecessary to get too concerned over the intricate details of where your mct oil is sourced from and whether the cow that produced your butter was milked within the last three days. Traditional bulletproof coffee recipes often call for 1 tablespoon of mct oil, but i’d recommend starting with 1 teaspoon and working your way up so you can determine how it makes you feel.)</p>
