<p><strong>Using Vinyl On Coffee Mugs</strong>. I thought adding stanley’s name and some paw prints to one side would make it extra cute. Save your design as.jpg file to your ipad or air drop it to your computer or laptop. I will say my favorite application method for the heat transfer vinyl on a mug was the mini iron. While you are making vinyl coffee mugs with your personalized design you need to be cautious about the following facts to get the perfect results.</p>

<p>They made the perfect gifts inside my personalized duffle bags that i made for the guests, too…. I tried a few different vinyls and methods and this is what i came up with for using iron on vinyl on ceramic. Many crafters have reported cases of the vinyl coming off their mugs. I also will go for a hot cup of tea or a delicious latte. Printable vinyl is best for smooth surfaces, like glass, plastic, metal, notebook covers, and even paper. Save your design as.jpg file to your ipad or air drop it to your computer or laptop.</p>
