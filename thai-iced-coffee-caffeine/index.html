<p>Thai iced coffee begins with very strong coffee. Thai iced coffee is also made with condensed milk, and it’s also often brewed from a blend of ingredients, not just coffee beans. Caffeine is shown in milligrams (mg). However, without the condensed milk, you can expect to drink quite a strong tasting beverage with heavy notes of the coffee bean coming through in every sip. I place the coffee in a blender and then i add the “thai” element, which includes dried cardamom, cinnamon, almond extract, and coconut sugar. Why not end this list with an exotic recipe?</p>
