<p>You can’t spit for 24 hours after tooth extraction because that can dislodge the blood clot formed at the site of extraction. We mix salt to make the solution isotonic and similar to natural tissue fluid and thus it is less irritating. But, you can’t enjoy toast, muffins, bagels, and crusty bread during the first few days of tooth extraction. Remember, that blood clot is still in your mouth protecting the gap where your tooth was and if it becomes dislodged, you may still suffer from dry socket. Drinking hot beverages too soon after surgery can dislodge the blood clot and cause an extremely painful condition known as “dry socket.” Can i drink coffee 24 hrs after an upper wisom tooth extraction?</p>

<p>Do not eat food that is too hot or too hard. When you return from the dentist’s office drink two to three glasses of water and eat a small meal, avoiding your extraction site. How long after tooth extraction can i have coffee? If you want then you can take the simple iced or lukewarm coffee without a straw. A common question we get is how long one should wait to have an alcoholic beverage after having had oral surgery done. You will be pleased to hear that coffee is on the list of foods and drinks recommended for patients who have just had a tooth removed.</p>
