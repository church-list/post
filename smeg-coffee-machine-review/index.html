<p>The functional design is however worse than the cheapest coffee machine you could possibly buy. You can use whatever ground coffee you prefer in your smeg coffee machine. While this review is about the smeg ecf01, it’s also about the simple pleasure of making good coffee. Read my honest review on the smeg tea kettle here &amp; shop all my favorite smeg products below! Using a combination of smeg’s own blend, illy classico arabica ground coffee, and lavazza qualitia rossa beans fresh from the grinder, the results are consistent and coffee shop quality, even if you don’t get the pleasing waft of coffee passing through the house like you do with a drip filter machine. The functional design is however worse than the cheapest coffee machine you could possibly buy.</p>
