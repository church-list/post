<p>Place 16 paper liners in muffin tins. Blueberry coffee cake muffins were born. Once the muffins are cooled, you can store them in an airtight container or sealed freezer bag at room temperature for up to 4 days. Well, who wouldn�t want to start their morning that way? Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl and mix well. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</p>

<p>Add the flour mixture, sour cream and vanilla extract to the stand mixer and beat until combined. Cream together butter and sugar until a grainy paste forms. That muffin needed to be moist, delicious, filled with something, and topped with crunchies. Then transfer the muffins to a wire rack and let cool completely. Layer the batter and streusel mixture into each muffin cup by adding a portion of the batter, topped by a layer of the streusel then another layer of the batter and a final layer of streusel. Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl and mix well.</p>
