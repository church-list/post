I tried this last week with vanilla protein powder. 1 tbs instant coffee powder. And this one tastes like a straight up milkshake. Has anyone tried adding instant coffee to their protein shake?</p>

<p>For example, adding vanilla whey protein isolate to my instant coffee tastes like french vanilla. (at the left edge) to foods that are high in protein (at the right edge). Add 2 tablespoons (i use a lot!) and ½ cup milk to the blender. I tried this last week with vanilla protein powder. If you add the protein powder when the coffee is warm, it will clump up, and there will be no saving it. It�s brewed by boiling a mixture of raw egg, coffee grounds, and water , and then straining the concoction.</p>
