<p><strong>Coffee Pooped Out By Cat</strong>. If you can�t afford the steep price, you�re just crap out of luck. The feces of this cat will be collected, finished and sold as kopi luwak. For instance, a cup of civet cat coffee in the us can go for up to $90. Kopi luwak is a coffee that consists of partially digested coffee cherries, which were eaten and defecated by the asian palm civet (paradoxurus hermaphroditus).it is therefore also called civet coffee.the cherries are fermented as they pass through a civet�s intestines, and after being defecated with other fecal matter, they are collected.</p>

Passionate for exotic coffee the kopi luwak coffee aroma is strong and rich, with a full body flavor that is close to syrupy. Does that sound disgusting, or tempting?</p>

<p>A company pitched the concept of java made from beans pooped out by cats at this.
