<p>October 15, 2017 at 3:02 pm. A french press is a coffee brewing device also known as cafetière, cafetière à piston, caffettiera a stantuffo, press pot, coffee press, or coffee plunger. Fill 4 glasses to the rim with ice. Press down on the french press to separate water from coffee grounds. Discard any hot water from the french press, and add the coffee grinds to the empty press. Transfer to the refrigerator 4 hours before serving.</p>
