<p><strong>How To Make Aeropress Coffee Less Bitter</strong>. The official aeropress recipe involves brewing a concentrate, which you then dilute with water. This will help speed up the extraction and produce less bitter flavors. This is less than the 9 bars of pressure used to make espresso, but a larger force reduces the amount of time the water is in contract with the coffee grounds. So, finer grids should take less time to get the oil and flavor from its interior, and allowing it to brew for longer than its standard time will make it bitter.</p>

<p>How you brew your coffee makes big difference in how it tastes. The short wet time helps to make aeropress coffee less bitter than other brewing methods. It’s great for using ‘on the go’ whilst travelling, but it’s equally good in the kitchen or office. See if that helps bring the bitterness down (while still getting you enough sweetness). Don’t get me wrong, it’s super easy to clean and i could try harder to avoid making a mess. To allow the coffee oils to make it into the cup while keeping even the smallest coffee grounds from doing the same.</p>

<p>The longer the grounds sit in hot water the more bitter acids are extracted. A bitter cup of coffee is usually the result of an extraction that went on for too long. Hotter water will extract the flavour from the coffee grounds faster than cooler water, but in the aeropress this will only make a subtle difference to the flavour of your extraction. I�d recommend you leave your kettle off the boil for a minute before starting your brew as a starting point. Bloom coffee grounds by pouring just enough hot water to cover the grounds. Next time you go shopping for coffee, look for labels that say medium roast.</p>
