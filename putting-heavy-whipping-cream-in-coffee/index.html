<p>If you want to make coffee with cream instead of milk, heavy cream can be a great option. While cream did not stop our fat burning, it may have slowed it down. You can halve or double (or triple!) the amount as needed. It enhances flavor, texture, and nutritional content. You can also ask them to put it in your coffee when you order at starbuck�s or peet�s. According to the package labeling of all heavy whipping creams i have purchased (mostly grass fed where available) there are zero carbs.</p>
<h3 id="you-could-go-all-for-heavy-cream-half-and-a-half-or-use-the-good-old-coffee-creamer-to-boost-the-taste">You could go all for heavy cream, half and a half, or use the good old coffee creamer to boost the taste.</h3>
<p>Adding whipping cream to coffee might be a little difficult in the beginning, because you want it to hold soft peaks and not disappear into the coffee. You can also ask them to put it in your coffee when you order at starbuck�s or peet�s. First, whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form. It uses the simple formula of coffee plus whipped cream, taking the cream you�re already putting in coffee just one small step further in the right direction. It makes you feel kinda bad. It will look foamy and perfect.</p>
