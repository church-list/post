<p><strong>Moka Pot Coffee Ratio</strong>. Mug is enough for you, a 2 cup (90ml) moka pot is a good size. Historically, moka pot coffee has been very bitter, which puts it at odds with the goals of specialty coffee. Superficially, the moka pot looks a great deal like a conventional percolator designed for use with a gas or electric stove. However, it is possible to make dense, concentrated coffee in a moka pot by maximizing the amount of coffee grounds you use.</p>

<p>Whether you’re just beginning to learn. Mug is enough for you, a 2 cup (90ml) moka pot is a good size. The flavor of moka pot coffee depends greatly on bean variety, roast level, fineness of grind, water profile, and the level of heat used. Historically, moka pot coffee has been very bitter, which puts it at odds with the goals of specialty coffee. And in an espresso shot of the same size, there is even less caffeine. Moka pot coffee (1.5 oz/42 ml) = 105 mg caffeine.</p>

<p>The right ratio of coffee grounds to water for a moka pot is 1:7 to 1:8. This kitchen essential for true coffee lovers has been pepping up morning routines in kitchens all over the world ever since it was created in italy in the 1930s. A moka pot is an amazing way to bring a taste of italy to your own kitchen. On my small 3 cup bialetti i get 0,5 deciliter coffee. Moka pots have a bit of a bad reputation in the specialty coffee world. If you have enough coffee for more than one cup, pour it out of the moka pot into a thermal flask to prevent the coffee tasting harsh and giving it a bitter, metallic edge.</p>
