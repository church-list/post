<p>Tom travels out to wyoming for this weeks episode to sit down at one of the town�s local hot spots, @bisonunion, to record with former green beret and the founder/owner of bison union, the man himself. Owned by tri star energy, both locations debuted a new store design and extended menu offerings. I made the mistake of letting other people roast our coffee when we started this venture and i’ll never do it again. (due to our partnership we can not list individual bags of brcc coffee on our site, we are stocked and will deliver or ship for free!) At brcc we import our high quality coffee beans from colombia &amp; brazil, then we personally blend and roast every one of our ass kicking coffees and ship directly to you. Save up to 25% with the black rifle coffee club.</p>
