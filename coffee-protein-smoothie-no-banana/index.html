<p>Here is an alternative way to get your buzz on with a cold, frothy drink that won’t fill you up with junk like those expensive treats from the coffee shop. I�ve made this recipe without banana, but feel free to throw one in if the urge strikes you. But, pair those two with iced coffee and a scoop of protein powder, and you’ve got yourself a new favorite breakfast drink. I love eating peanut butter by the spoonful, but sometimes it can be hard to stop. Coffee, when consumed in moderation, can be beneficial for the heart. Make it without banana by subbing in 1/4 cup of coconut milk and adding a few ice cubes.</p>

<p>My friend sheldon gave me a version of this coffee banana protein smoothie recipe years ago, but i modified that recipe. If you are generous, you could share this with someone in small glasses like these. Enjoy your coffee banana smoothie immediately! Amazon prime offers free delivery from whole foods if you spend $35, and amazon sells protein powder and instant coffee (two of the ingredients in this coffee smoothie) at a great price. I used cashew butter b/c that�s what i had. Call me crazy, but i don’t think bananas and coffee are a good flavor combination.</p>
