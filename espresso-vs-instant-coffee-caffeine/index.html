<p><strong>Espresso Vs Instant Coffee Caffeine</strong>. The average cup of coffee contains about 100 milligrams of coffee, but there is a lot of variation. Ground coffee has a higher caffeine content. Caffeine one of the biggest differences between fresh coffee and instant coffee is the caffeine content. So actually there is more caffeine in an average cup of drip coffee than in espresso.</p>

<p>You’re likely to have at least 8 ounces, and that�s typically 95 to 128 mg of caffeine. Whereas a 12 oz brewed coffee has about 120 milligrams. Instant cappuccino does have caffeine in it: Instant coffee is like a regular coffee that’s brewed in an industrial caffeinating kit to have more taste and flavor as possible. An espresso often contains as little as 50 milligrams per shot, while a cup of drip coffee can easily contain 200 milligrams of caffeine. In beverage perspective, espresso is served in much smaller volume, thus, we get less caffeine but in a volume perspective, espresso has more caffeine compared to drip coffee because of its higher concentration of solubles in 1 oz of coffee.</p>

<p>Of course, these are simply averages, but you get the gist. Determining the caffeine levels of coffee and espresso drinks can be very tricky. Double espresso has nearly 125 mg of caffeine. So, yes, espresso technically has more caffeine. As a coffee drinker, you no doubt have a preference for the type of coffee you enjoy, it might be ground coffee, brewed and freshly made, it might be coffee pods or capsules, with all the flavour and convenience they offer, or it might be the simplicity, taste and cost of instant coffee. I don’t really consider instant cappuccino to be “coffee”, but i digress… the reason the amount of caffeine is so vast is that instant coffee is quite temperamental and manufacturers use a whole host of different beans and blends to make it.</p>
