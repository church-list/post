<p><strong>French Press Iced Coffee Instructions</strong>. With time, the version has continued to evolve into the french press we know today — or a manual brewing system in which coffee grounds are steeped in hot water before being pressed to the bottom of the beaker, helping to separate the grounds from the liquid. Refrigerate for 10 to 12 hours. After the coffee has time to brew, gently press down the plunger on your french press. If your coffee seems strong enough but tastes bitter, adjust the grind size on your conical burr grinder to a bit coarser.</p>

<p>If you like your coffee black you can add water to dilute it to your desired strength. Fill it up halfway to the top saturating all the grounds, making sure that there are no dry spots. Allow the coffee to sit 12 hours or overnight. Pour the grounds into a french press. Fill 4 glasses to the rim. You can do so by grinding your coffee beans and letting it sit and steep in your french.</p>

<p>Add coffee grounds and then zero out or tare your scale. Despite this fun origin story, the patent of the french press coffee maker actually came from the italians. The design of the actual french press hasn’t changed much since its inception about 100 years ago. Pour freshly brewed coffee into the steam pitcher. Despite being associated with artisanal coffee shops, french presses are surprisingly easy to use. Discard hot water and place the french press on your scale.</p>
