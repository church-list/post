<p><strong>How To Strain Cold Brew Coffee</strong>. It is the cooling caffeinated refreshment we all need to power our spring and summer fun.

<p>The reason is that you do not want to brew hot coffee, chill the coffee, and then create iced coffee. If you brew a 1:2 concentrate, you should be able to add 8 or 9 oz. The dripster cold brew coffee maker’s innovative design brings drip brewing to the home. You can serve it over ice, or heat it up and enjoy cold. Pour out the iced coffee concentrate. I usually left mine brewing from 14 to 16 hours.</p>

<p>I usually left mine brewing from 14 to 16 hours. You see, the trouble with boiling or very hot water is that the acids and oils separate from the mash when subject to heat. It will taste like old, bitter coffee, and nobody wants that. If you brew a 1:2 concentrate, you should be able to add 8 or 9 oz. When your cold brew is done steeping, you strain it, dilute it to your desired potency, then enjoy! I�ve been putting loose grounds with water in a large ball jar and then straining the bulk out with my french press, but from there it�s more difficult.</p>
