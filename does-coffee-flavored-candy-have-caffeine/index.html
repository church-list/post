<p><strong>Does Coffee Flavored Candy Have Caffeine</strong>. His throat is healing and he can’t have liquids yet but he loves coffee. There are three sources of coffee flavoring. So there is no safety in knowing how much caffeine you may get from a cup of decaf coffee. For most young, healthy adults, caffeine doesn�t appear to noticeably affect blood sugar (glucose) levels, and having up to 400 milligrams a day appears to be safe.</p>

Yes, although it does not have much it still has a little caffeine in it. If you order a cup of decaf coffee at a coffee bar or restaurant, independent studies have shown a great variance in the amount of caffeine in the cup even on the same day from the very same place. Has that cafe con leche flavor band the creamy taste is very genuine.</p>

<p>Thank you, p.s brother is 59 year old, not a child. A good way to satisfy dessert cravings without the high calories. If you order a cup of decaf coffee at a coffee bar or restaurant, independent studies have shown a great variance in the amount of caffeine in the cup even on the same day from the very same place. High caffeine foods and drinks include chocolate covered coffee beans, coffee, energy drinks, espresso, sodas, green tea, black tea, dark chocolate, coffee liqueur, and baked goods containing chocolate. Candy won’t do as he will choke. I will order if you have them.</p>
