<p><strong>How Do You Cold Brew Coffee</strong>. Cold brew coffee is made by steeping coarsely ground coffee beans in water. To make cold brew coffee, coarse coffee grounds are immersed in water for a minimum of 12—and up to 24—hours (unlike drip coffee where hot water passes through the coffee grounds, dissolving the coffee and water together as it falls into a carafe), explains rounds. Before you start brewing, there are a few things to keep in mind so you can create the best coffee for you—a cold brew so good, you ditch the cafe for good (ok, maybe you’ll still stop in for a scone). Use your favorite roast, but make sure it�s ground very coarsely so it won�t cloud the water.</p>

<p>Most often, the ratio of coffee to water is 1:4, 1:4.2, 1:4.6, or 1:4.8 to obtain a concentrate, which should then be diluted with ice and water or milk. You can make cold brew at home using any coffee roast you like. Cold brew is not the only type of cold coffee drink. Transfer the coffee grounds to the container you�re using to make the cold brew. The coarser grind gives the cold brew a smoother taste and also makes it easier to strain. The basic formula for cold brew is one pound of ground coffee beans to one gallon.</p>

<p>Hot water tends to pull out more of the acidity in coffee, while cold water will not. But, the temperature matter as well. Use your favorite roast, but make sure it�s ground very coarsely so it won�t cloud the water. To brew this coffee, you’re going to steep cold brew coffee grounds in water that can be between 70 to 35 degrees fahrenheit (water that is closer to room temperature will give you a better flavor) from anywhere from 2 hours (for those who need a coffee fix asap) and up to 24 hours. The basic formula for cold brew is one pound of ground coffee beans to one gallon.
