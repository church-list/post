<p>If i can drink ice coffee after wisdom tooth extraction hi ! (as iced coffee isnï¿½t a thick liquid.) 5 days is plenty of time. Wisdom teeth do not always require removal. After getting a tooth extracted, youâ€™ll need to protect the extraction site by waiting 24 hours before rinsing your mouth, flossing, or brushing your teeth. Donï¿½t drink it with a straw because. Whether you are drinking water, powerade, a smoothie, or even sweet tea, do so from a glass.</p>

<p>Keep your mouth clean by swishing salt water very gently every 2 hours and after meals. The pyhtonutrients in coffee may have some health benefits. I had my 2 wisdom tooth remove last january 30 both at the bottom left side still swollen right side looks fne its my 4 days now. When can i drink coffee after wisdom tooth extraction? Caffeine might make the anesthetic wear off sooner, though. Yes, that hot cup of coffee or tea will have to wait on your healing.</p>
