<p>Coconut cream and milk are made from the same ingredients (coconut, water, and sometimes guar gum), but much like regular milk compared to heavy cream, coconut cream has a higher fat content and a thicker texture than coconut milk. Make keto coffee creamers at home is very easy. I like this recipe because it uses coconut milk which contain medium chain fatty acids that readily convert to ketones. This chocolate keto coffee creamer is made with coconut milk, honey as sweetener, and add vanilla extract with cocoa powder flavor. I have been doing coffee with grass fed butter and mct oil for a couple of years now and i love it. Because it is naturally low in carbs and high in fat, it would make a great addition to your coffee.</p>

<p>1 can full fat coconut milk. Make keto coffee creamers at home is very easy. Homemade powdered vanilla coffee creamer. When i created this recipe for keto coffee creamer it was initially intended as a sub for sweetened condensed milk, but after i made it i realized how perfect it was as a coffee creamer. I wanted to reduce my level of animal fat consumption (even though they are grass fed) so, with low expectations, i tried the mitomix keto creamer with coconut milk. It’s easy to sweeten and flavor it any way you want.</p>
