<p>How do i refinish a faux wood coffee table that isnï¿½t wood or veneer? You can refinish veneer almost the same as you would refinish a piece of solid wood, as long as you take precautions to avoid damaging the thin veneer. Veneered furniture can be refinished like other wood furniture, as long as the veneer is not too thin, and you take care not to remove too much of the veneer when removing the old finish.

<p>The process is relatively simple. To refinish a coffee table, start by sanding off the old finish. ðŸ™‚ if it takes two people to move that little coffee table, itï¿½s probably. After that, apply a new finish like furniture oil, wood stain, varnish, or paint that will give the coffee table the final look you want. I simply sprayed it on and wiped it off. That should be your first clue.</p>
