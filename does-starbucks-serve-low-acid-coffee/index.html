While acid can be lessened and neutralized, it still has a primary function in creating the perfect brew of coffee. Made with the same 100% arabica beans, starbucks via ® instant offers the same starbucks ® coffee—in an instant. What most are unaware of is that arabica coffee is also low in acidity due to its lower caffeine content. The answer is no, you can drink the decaf coffee with acid reflux which is less acidic coffee or free of acid, where the most amount of caffeine has been removed to make it healthy. Scientifically, acid exists in coffee because of its hydrogen ion make up, which contributes to a higher reading on the ph scale.</p>
