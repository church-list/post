<p><strong>Does Coffee Stain Teeth Enamel</strong>. Tea like coffee, tea contains tannins that can stain your teeth. Wines (including white), teas, and coffee. It’s not the color of drinks/food that stain teeth, but the acidity that opens the pores in the tooth enamel which allows staining. Drinking coffee regularly for a long period of time can stain your teeth.</p>

<p>Tea like coffee, tea contains tannins that can stain your teeth. This is because the coffee stain on the surface of the teeth prevents the bleaching agent from reaching the enamel. The answer to “will putting cream in my coffee still stain my teeth” is; Like coffee, tea contains several compounds — tannins in particular — that’s known to stain teeth. Wine, especially red wine, which contains chromogens and tannins, is very instrumental in staining teeth.however, white wine may also encourage teeth staining. It contains microscopic pits, ridges and fissures that can hold microscopic particles.</p>

<p>As tannins in coffee build up on tooth enamel, they cause discoloration. I have been making a drink with lemon, turmeric, honey, pepper and hot water. But does caffeine in coffee contribute to stains? Unfortunately, all types of tea could cause your teeth to discolor and it could have a more detrimental effect on teeth discoloration compared to coffee. Because coffee is an acidic beverage, the coffee acid colors the enamel surface. Staining is, by far, the most common effect of brushing teeth after drinking coffee.</p>
