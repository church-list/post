<p>Atlas coffee club is a coffee subscription that helps people discover coffee from around the world. One of the standout features of this coffee subscription box is the welcome gift: Unlike some subscription services that offer small tastings, the atlas coffee club box tries to give you a nice new coffee to enjoy throughout the month (if it lasts that long). Unlike trade coffee, it roasts those beans itself in austin, texas, and gets them to your door shortly thereafter. It’s our gift to you with your coffee subscription. Centered around only one roast that changes weekly, customers can choose between two bag sizes.</p>
