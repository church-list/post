<p>According to new research involving nearly 5,000 people with chronic kidney disease, a hike in daily caffeine intake appeared to lower their odds of an early death. Is coffee bad for your kidney? If you are onto binge consumption, the caffeine in the coffee is bound to raise the blood pressure level. Is coffee bad for your kidneys comes down to a number of individual factors, but for healthy people, the answer is almost certainly no. There is limited evidence to suggest that it causes an increased risk of kidney disease, and there is evidence it both helps and hinders kidney function. Both decaf and common coffee cause minerals to be excreted in urine including calcium, magnesium and zinc.</p>

<p>Researchers have found that it might be good. Coffee provides your body with a huge amount of antioxidants which keep your body healthy, however it also does contribute to some nasty side effects if it is consumed excessively. Those with kidney problems or kidney failure may need to restrict their fluid intake, but for most people, drinking 1.5 to 2 liters (3 to 4 pints) of water per day is a healthy. That�s the suggestion of a new study that found that among more than 2,300 americans with chronic kidney disease, those who drank the most caffeinated drinks reduced their risk of premature death. However, in more current clinical studies, consumption of coffee was not noted to be a risk factor for pkd progression. Decaf raises ldl cholesterol, fatty acids and apolipoprotein b, which is dangerous for stage 3 kidney disease patients.</p>
