<p>Although in english, expressions like do you want to~ and don�t you want to~ are informal invitations, japanese questions with ~tai can�t be used to express an invitation when politeness is required. Canned coffee, which is not very popular outside of japan, iced coffee and morning service, a coffee set that comes with free bread/toast or eggs, are just some of the interesting aspects of thejapanese coffee culture that coffee lovers should try while in japan. Today i’m sharing how the japanese make iced coffee, which to us is “the best” way to enjoy coffee (until we find a better way). Do you want coffee or tea? The easiest way to make iced coffee also turns out to be the best. いいえ、お持ち帰りで and there you have it!</p>

<p>You can’t beat freshly ground coffee for your daily cup of joe, but it’s hard to compete with the novelty of these individually packaged cardboard pour overs, a.k.a. Brewing coffee with hot water quickly dissolves the desired flavors and aromatics in ground coffee. Visit japan and instead of a coffee chain shop, you�ll see coffee vending machines on practically every street corner. This series first launched in 1992, and, celebrating its 25th birthday in 2017, has become synonymous with “japanese canned coffee.” The two most popular beverages, tea and coffee, each have dedicated followers who will insist one is better than the other. Do you want to join me :</p>
