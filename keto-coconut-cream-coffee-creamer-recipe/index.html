<p><strong>Keto Coconut Cream Coffee Creamer Recipe</strong>. When i created this recipe for keto coffee creamer it was initially intended as a sub for sweetened condensed milk, but after i made it i realized how perfect it was as a coffee creamer. If youâ€™re looking for a vegan coffee creamer thatâ€™s also keto compliant, coconut milk or coconut cream is a wonderful option. Actually, letï¿½s call it a fat bomb for your coffee.if you are looking to bump up the fat even more, blend a quarter cup (4 tablespoons) of high quality mct oil into the mixture. As such, itâ€™s perfect for travel.</p>
