<h3 id="basically-koeblers-article-makes-a-case-that-coffee-is-in-imminent-danger-for-three-reasons">Basically, koebler’s article makes a case that coffee is in imminent danger for three reasons:</h3>
<p>Homeowners can grow their own coffee beans. Purchase green, unroasted coffee beans from a coffee importer or get a whole coffee cherry from a coffee plant. The way we grow, roast, buy and consume coffee is evolving and as lovers of coffee, we�ve never had it so good. Each cherry has two seeds, which are the beans that are washed, roasted and ground for coffee. You can grow coffee from seed, but i recommend buying a plant from your local nursery since it can take a few years before a seed grows into a plant mature enough to produce cherries the beans come from. When spring arrives, begin watering your plants well and continue to water on a regular basis, twice a week and deeply.</p>
