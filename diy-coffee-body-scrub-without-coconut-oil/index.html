<p>Use a circular, upward motion to improve circulation. 1 cup coffee grounds 1 cup fractionated coconut oil or carrier oil of choice* 3/4 cup sugar or fine sea salt 1 tablespoon vanilla extract or 2 teaspoons powder. Each recipe calls for fractionated coconut oil, but you’re welcome to use any liquid carrier oil of your choosing. ♥ there’s a little back story on this homemade sugar and salt scrub recipe. I prefer glass jars and while there are many cute ones available, mason jars make great storage containers. Can you make a coffee body scrub without oil?</p>
