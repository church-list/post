<p><strong>Coffee Shops Open Late</strong>. I&amp;#39;m talking about late as in closes at 11:30pm or later, most places we&amp;#39;ve found close at 10 or earlier. Without the loud music, way too drunk people, and the uncomfortably close quarters. It’s a place you can make memories. Starbucks 34th and walnut, open until 11:30 p.m.</p>
