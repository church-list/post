<p><strong>Cuisinart Coffee Maker Charcoal Filter Target</strong>. Our cuisinart coffee maker has been reliably doing it�s job for several years; The only catch has been that it has a replaceable charcoal water filter which needs to be replaced every 60 days. Generally, this depends on a number of factors including the model of the cuisinart coffee machine, the capacity of the machine, and the quantity of coffee to brew. These filters are relatively expensive if purchased from cuisinart.</p>
