<p><strong>Clean Coffee Maker With Vinegar Martha Stewart</strong>. First, let�s get the terminology out of the way. To clean a coffee maker with apple cider vinegar, simply fill the carafe with warm water up to about 6 cups. Wipe down the inside of everything. The martha stewart website points out how important it is to clean not only the outside of your coffee maker but also the inside of the carafe, as coffee buildup will also accumulate in these areas.</p>

<p>In order to keep your coffee maker running smoothly, (and your mornings enjoyable) you need to keep it clean. Using equal amounts of water and vinegar, wet a washcloth and wipe down the outside of your machine. Most experts recommend that a deep clean with vinegar should be done about once a month, but daily maintenance is also a must. Fill the water reservoir halfway full with white distilled vinegar, which is about 10 ounces on most machines. Gotta go and clean mine now for next a.m. Martha stewart recommends letting ½ cup of vinegar sit in the bowl for an hour before.</p>
