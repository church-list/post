<p>I think it is a fair price. Just put the coleman camping coffee maker on your camp stove while you decide whether you want your eggs sunny side up or over easy. Additional features of this travel coffee maker that makes it a big hit among travelers, campers, and rv owners include the water level meter to show you how much water you. And this most effective outdoor coffee maker makes it easy and fast. If you’re sporting a coleman coffee maker (like the propane one in our list), then you’ll be able to functionally craft your coffee as if you were at home, using the pot on your counter. Storing it in its original box certainly will not offer that much protection.</p>

<p>The camping coffee maker costs $43.48 (at the time of writing). Reusable, washable filter saves on costs. But the main difference is the source of heat. Another option by the traditional camping brand coleman, this is also an extremely hardy and reliable coffee maker which is perfectly suited to the outdoors. The coleman quikpot propane camping coffee maker is designed to give you your piping hot coffee in under 20 minutes and has everything wrapped up in a nice little package. This device resembles your favorite french press coffee maker—toss in ground coffee, add hot water, let it steep, then plunge and pour.</p>
