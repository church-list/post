<p><strong>Keto Instant Iced Coffee Recipe</strong>. It’s made with condensed milk and coconut milk, and only contains 1g net carbs, which means you can have it all day long and still be in ketosis. Every week, i’d easily spend a good $30 on coffee shop coffees. It is using brewed coffee or instant coffee as the main ingredient. When it comes to keto coffee drinks, my favorite recipes to make are a frappucinos, peppermint mochas, and this easy iced coffee.</p>
