<p><strong>Mixing Protein Shake With Coffee</strong>. ðŸ˜‰ instead of mixing coffee directly with the protein shake, weâ€™re freezing the brewed coffee first, adding some avocado and coconut cream to thicken, and then blending everything together to create a thick and frosty shake. It was a waste of perfectly good protein powder and perfectly good coffee. Whey protein powder in coffee? If you want to add an entire scoop of whey protein in your coffee, mix in 1/2 scoop first until the powder is dissolved, then mix in the 2nd half.</p>

<p>Theyâ€™re small, gooey blobs of protein powder. I blend it the night before and put it in the fridge to give it time for the air to settle out of it by next morning. But yet, they still do. It results in just a few clumps that are soft and easy to smoosh against the side of the mug with a spoon. So maybe donï¿½t try that. Obviously, this only applies if you are indeed making a protein shake anyway.</p>

<p>240 ml (1 cup) freshly brewed hot coffee. Wonderful in the summertime before a workout, you can whip up a cold or frozen coffee protein shake in no time. But mixing it takes less than a minute. 1 1/2 teaspoons maple syrup, more to taste. With that in mind, hereâ€™s my 7 pro tips for getting coffee and protein powder to mix: In the case of protein, this effect occurs partly because protein is filling, which may reduce how much food you eat (11,12,13).at the same time, protein can help to lower cravings for food (14,15), while offering some metabolic improvements as well (16,17,18).for coffee, the underlying mechanisms are different.</p>
