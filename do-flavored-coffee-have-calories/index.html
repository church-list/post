<p><strong>Do Flavored Coffee Have Calories</strong>. They’d rather take their caffeine in the form of caramel, chocolate, or hazelnut flavored treat than drink a bitter cup of coffee, even with cream and sugar. A latte from mcdonalds, for example, can contain upwards of 170 calories. It�s all processed beans and such. If not, then how do they add calorie free flavor?</p>

<p>I drink my coffee with just creamer in it and i always go lower. This is true to a point, but you won’t ever break past 7 or 8 calories for a serving of coffee. They’d rather take their caffeine in the form of caramel, chocolate, or hazelnut flavored treat than drink a bitter cup of coffee, even with cream and sugar. Regular coffee can be pretty dark and bitter. Coffee is low in calories when trying to lose weight, you have to create. A latte from mcdonalds, for example, can contain upwards of 170 calories.</p>
<h3 id="cold-brew-on-the-other-hand-is-steeped-for-at-least-12-hours-with-a-single-serving-having-just-under-10-calories">Cold brew, on the other hand, is steeped for at least 12 hours, with a single serving having just under 10 calories.</h3>
<p>A latte from mcdonalds, for example, can contain upwards of 170 calories. Same thing with darker roasts since you taste more burnt than the coffee itself. If i want to add flavoring to coffee without too many carbs i use flavored creamers. Doesnt seem to make sense to me. Espresso, for example, has a very strong flavor, and a typical shot weight 1 ounce and has one calorie. If you’ve been sipping your flavored coffee in blissful oblivion until now, you might want to sit for this (and put your cup down, too).</p>
