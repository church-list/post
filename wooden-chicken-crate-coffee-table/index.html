<p><strong>Wooden Chicken Crate Coffee Table</strong>. I do have chickens, but their coop is actually the size of a large storage building! Can you imagine how excited i was to find this chicken coop at a local thrift shop? This is the perfect place to store seldom used items that are used in the living room, like bedding for a fold out couch, or photo albums. Do not contact me with unsolicited services or offers</p>
