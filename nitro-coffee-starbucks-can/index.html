It’s no wonder that nitro cold brew has quickly bubbled up to one of the top spots in the starbucks drinks menu ever since it was first introduced in 2016, soon joined by nitro cold brew with sweet cream and nitro cold brew with cascara cold foam. There is also room in the can to add milk if you don�t want to use a coffee cup. Available now at all major online retailers. It�s made and served differently, and it has a unique look, taste, and texture. Awesome for when starbucks is closed or i just don�t want to go out.</p>
