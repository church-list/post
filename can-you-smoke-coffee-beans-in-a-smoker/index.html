<p>I;m not sure what effect putting roasted beans into a 225 degree smoker will have on the cup. Coffee beans give off a huge amount of smoke when they roast. It came out <em>ok</em>, considering that it was a test run. First, you cook it in the smoker for four hours and then you add beer to it, let it sit, and cook it in the oven for another four hours. You can do this on a gas grill too! If this is your first visit, be sure to check out the faq by clicking the link above.</p>

<p>Watch closely so the sugar in the beans doesn’t burn. Coffee beans give off a huge amount of smoke when they roast. You can do this on a gas grill too! The longer they are on the smoker, the stronger the smoked flavor will be. Preheat the grill to about 450 degrees fahrenheit until the smoker chips start smoking. Rolling coffee grounds or coffee beans up into “caffeine sticks,” using cigarette paper or glass tubes, has gone “viral,” as teens learn how to smoke coffee from a variety of websites.</p>
