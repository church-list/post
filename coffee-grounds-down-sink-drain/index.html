<p>How to dispose of coffee grounds. Coffee grounds can be carried by water in small amounts, but over time, they build up and clump together. “it keeps them clear,” they would say, as they dumped their morning grounds down their delicate plumbing system. As with any food waste, surely they should be rinsed down with water so as not to choke the pipe, but i suspect coffee grounds pose no unique problem. First, place a plunger over the sink drain opening. Ideally, nothing could happen, which often occurs with clean, new, or abs drain lines.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-let-them-down-the-drain-coffee-grounds-dont-break-down-like-other-foods">If you let them down the drain, coffee grounds don’t break down like other foods.</h3>
<p>Okay, the message is loud and clear about where not to dispose of. Wipe clean with a towel and rinse off the remaining grounds in the sink. Run the faucet on hot for a few minutes to push any coffee grounds that have gotten into the drain. Do the grounds clean it or clog it? Additionally, coffee grounds can cause major septic system problems, so keeping them out of your plumbing is especially important if you have a septic tank. They will eventually build up inside the drains thus creating clogs that will prevent the sink drain from working effectively.</p>
