<p><strong>Whipped Coffee Recipe No Sugar</strong>. However, no sugar is preferable to me. Either hand whisk or use an electric mixer until the mixture is fluffy and light. Some people call it whipped coffee, some people call it tic tok coffee, but everyone calls it delicious. Mix together the whipped coffee and the milk for a frothy coffee treat.</p>
