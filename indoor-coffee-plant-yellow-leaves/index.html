<p><strong>Indoor Coffee Plant Yellow Leaves</strong>. Your plant is paling from green to yellow. To simulte these conditions, mist your plants with water several times a week. If the older leaves on your plant are turning yellow and the new leaves are very light green, it could be a sign of a nitrogen deficiency. Initially i thought it was a black leaf spot problem but an antifungal spray i�ve been using hasnt helped land the problem has continued.</p>

<p>Generally, this yellowness will appear in a mosaic pattern, not solid yellow, and the leaves may have unsightly, crunchy brown tips but will not fall off easily. Sick plants need plant food The humidity around the plant will need to stay high as well. Initially i thought it was a black leaf spot problem but an antifungal spray i�ve been using hasnt helped land the problem has continued. This altogether means that your plant is overwatered. This can be caused by too much calcium in the water if you�re using hard water or by a nitrogen deficiency.</p>
