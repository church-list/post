<p>There’s a lot of confusion in this area. You won�t find a bitter cup of coffee in new orleans because most coffee served there is creole coffee. Just make your coffee in a standard coffee maker like you normally do, but add 1 tsp of the chai spice mixture to the ground coffee for every 4 cups you’re making. Add 2 cups water, stirring gently to wet the grounds, then add remaining 8 cups water, agitating the grounds as little as. Coffee over ice, or iced coffee, is when you make regular coffee and pour it over ice to cool it. For one, i no longer found the nola iced coffee to be too sweet.</p>
