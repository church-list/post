<p><strong>Does Coffee Have Carbohydrates</strong>. If there is any sugar or high fructose corn syrup on the ingredient list, then, yes, that type of flavored coffee does have carbs. Chicory dried, roasted and ground up chicory roots are sometimes added to real coffee to cut the caffeine. So, does my overused analogy have a leg to stand on? Coffee contains thousands of ingredients such as carbohydrates, amino acids, and lipids.</p>

<p>Even though black coffee has negligible calories, it does trigger some digestive functions. High intake of boiled, unfiltered coffee has been associated with mild increase in cholesterol levels. However, adding other ingredients can quickly ramp up that number. Your coffee habit is probably fine and may even have some benefits. A medium chocolate milkshake from your favorite fast food chain can contain up to 380 calories. Black coffee and plain espresso contain almost no carbs, typically fewer than 1 gram in a traditional serving size.</p>

<p>However, adding other ingredients can quickly ramp up that number. Your coffee habit is probably fine and may even have some benefits. Whether it’s from coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate, most americans get caffeine every day. Coffee does not have carbohydrates, nor does plain cream or half and half. Caffeine doesn’t impact carb count so whether you drink regular or decaf, the carbohydrates in a cup of black coffee will be the same. Carbs come with the sugar additives or milk you put in your coffee.</p>
