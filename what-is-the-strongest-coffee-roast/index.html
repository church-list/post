<p><strong>What Is The Strongest Coffee Roast</strong>. Black insomnia coffee claims to be the strongest coffee in the world, with 300 percent more caffeine than your morning starbucks. The blend contains both arabica and robusta beans, which are certified usda organic and fair trade, and is slow roasted for intensity. Our last coffee also claims to be the strongest coffee in the world. And if you’re looking at purely caffeine content, it’s hard to argue that fact.</p>
