<p>Cat beans is an expression commonly used when referring to coffee beans that have been. Kopi luwak, also known as civet coffee, refers to a unique type of coffee that is obtained from seeds of berries eaten by the luwak. As folklore has it, civet coffee, or kopi luwak in indonesian, was discovered by plantation workers in colonized indonesia. Civet is popularly known as the cat that eats coffee beans. According to the manila coffee house, the palm civet just happens to like to ingest the ripest and reddest coffee beans, which also happen to be the ones best for brewing.

<p>The coffee cherries are then picked out from poop aka poop coffee. Kopi luwak has become hugely popular worldwide, and as a result wild luwaks (palm civets) are being poached and caged in terrible conditions all over south east asia, and force fed coffee cherries. Poor luwaks, animal that eats coffee beans, that are later used to make the most expensive coffee, are trapped in cages. It’s one of the fastest extinctions of an animal specie in the wilderness. This is the reason kopi luwak is also called cat poop coffee or civet cat coffee. Kopi luwak is the coffee that has been digested by an asian palm civet.</p>
