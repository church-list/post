<p>I cold brew coffee and steep at room temperature for about 18 hours, sometimes a little less. But you can also try making iced coffee and cold brew at home, including hot bloom cold brew if you never quite love the taste of the conventional stuff. The beloved beverage can be made with items ranging from a french press to a mason jar, and its two main brewing methods involve steeping coffee grounds in cold water anywhere from 12 to 24 hours or using a drip style. Rather handily as cold brew coffee can be refrigerated for up to two weeks and still retain its aromatic and concentrated coffee flavour, this unit has been designed to neatly slot inside most regular sized refrigerator doors so that you can go straight from. Sip it straight, water it down, or milk it for all it�s worth. I find the coffee is smoother when cold brewed and my husband likes coffee cold, so it really works fine for both of us.</p>
