<p><strong>Acid Free Coffee Canada</strong>. There aren’t many k cups companies that have created french roast, low acid blends, but french roasts actually have lower acid because darker coffees are roasted for longer, which helps to. Treating coffee is a common way to reduce its acidity. A bold yet balanced cup with smooth sweetness, a fruity acidity (the brightness of the coffee�s taste) and clean finish. Coffee�s naturally acidic properties are what give your brew that distinctly tart, bright, and sour taste.</p>
