<p><strong>How To Make Coffee Whipped Cream Without Instant Coffee</strong>. The original tiktok trend called for whipping by hand, but we use a hand blender for ease. Dalgona coffee is equal portions of instant coffee, granulated sugar, and hot water that’s whipped together and turned into a rich, coffee cream, then served over milk. Add the hot water, sugar, and instant coffee to a bowl. Boil some hot water in a tea kettle or in a small saucepan.</p>

<p>A lot of dalgona coffee videos on tiktok show people using a whisk to whip the ingredients together. Stir the coffee and hot water together until the coffee granules are dissolved. Dalgona coffee is traditionally an iced coffee drink made of a combination of sweet, fluffy whipped coffee topping served on top of iced milk. Coffee can sometimes be quite acidic so older cream may curdle in it. Whisk in half of the cold water to combine. The coffee whipped cream could be used as a frosting for cakes, tarts, or even just a topping for regular black coffee.</p>
