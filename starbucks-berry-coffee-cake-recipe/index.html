<p>Alternately, add flour mixture and milk to batter, beginning and ending with flour. This is without a doubt the best blueberry coffee cake i have ever had! Cover berries with remaining batter and spread the top evenly with a spatula (some berries will show through). Tried other of their fads, but stayed true to just the coffee, until, one day, their very berry coffee cake caught my eye. You may find slight variations of the cake at different starbucks locations. If your looking for a traditional coffee cake type recipe, this is probably not for you.</p>

<p>I was in love instantly and knew it was the perfect crumb cake for brunches at my house and to share with girlfriends over a cup of java. Cover berries with remaining batter and spread the top evenly with a spatula (some berries will show through). It’s fruity and refreshing iced tea with just the right caffeine hit. I love starbucks very berry cake and most often buy them along with my drink. Sometimes there is a ribbon of cinnamon running through the middle of the cake, and sometimes the cake is dusted with a bit of powdered sugar. And the cake comes together in a snap.</p>
