And in 2020, we sealed this lively, tangy coffee into our airtight fresh brew cans, so you can enjoy 4 to 6 cups of fresh taste, every time. Although the gulf between these two types is huge, we think all can agree that our breakfast blend is one fine coffee. Our breakfast blend is a medium roast and is made up of our most popular central american coffee beans.</p>
