<p><strong>Roast Your Own Coffee Kona</strong>. I ordered the dark kona roast. I started with one pound of captain cook�s kona coffee, which is a hawaiian bean. This roast highlights the smooth kona flavor, and is never harsh or bitter. Kona coffee is gourmet coffee grown in the north and south districts of kona, leeward side of the big island of hawaii.</p>

<p>From our farm to your cup This medium roast is made up of a proprietary blend of 100% kona beans. There are lots of talks around kona coffee and with no doubt the taste is big part of it. It may cost more but it is worth every cent. Consequently there is a difference in quality of beans between the coffee farms. The medium roast offers an optimal mix of terra and roast profiles.</p>
<h3 id="time-and-temperature-vary-depending-on-the-desired-results">Time and temperature vary depending on the desired results.</h3>
<p>We grow 7 different varieties of coffee and process them using 4 different methods. It is a good idea to have one variety of coffee bean as the base which will account for 50% of your blend. In case you didn’t know, most coffee cherries grow with 2 seeds within giving that appearance of two round shapes pressed together. Kama’aina (local) families own most of the local coffee farms and have for generations. Medium roast kona tastes like coffee should, rich, mellow, no bitterness. Roast your own custom label big island.</p>
