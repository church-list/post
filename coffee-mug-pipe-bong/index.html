<p>The top space is for your steaming coffee that many of us direly need to start thinking coherently. The grav coffee mug bubbler is made from thick borosilicate glass, and measures 7” inches tall from the base of the mug to the top of the straw neck mouthpiece. Go to their website, and you�ll find only smoking tobacco is. Why have a cup of coffee and a pipe, when you can have a cup of coffee that is a pipe?!!? Kind of a misnomer, to be honest, if you ask me, as i think the more technical term for this is a tumbler (hence the title). The coffee mug pipe is a handy tumbler that extends out into a water pipe for smoking tobacco.</p>
