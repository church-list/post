<p><strong>How To Make Iced Coffee With Instant Coffee</strong>. Like you saw in the video, i prefer to use milk + instant coffee grounds and then pour the dissolved mixture over ice. Sweetened condensed milk provides sweetness and creaminess at the same time so you don�t need to add any other creamer or sugar. Mix it in a shaker or blender your 1 tsp nescafe instant coffee and 2 tsp hot water, 1 cup milk, cold water, and 1 tsp of sugar and ice cubes. Cold brew coffee is brewed with cold water so that does not happen because the oils and acids are not as.</p>
