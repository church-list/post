<p>If you suffer from acid reflux, is low acid coffee ok? The answer is no, you can drink the decaf coffee with acid reflux which is less acidic coffee or free of acid, where the most amount of caffeine has been removed to make it healthy. Coffee can stimulate excess gastric acid secretions that may rise up to your esophagus. Puroast low acid coffee is slowly roasted in a wood fire, a process that allows each bean to slowly but perfectly roast wholly on its own. But because coffee is still—let�s be real—pretty damn perfect, there�s a solution: Besides the type of beans used, the best coffee that can ease acid reflux and heartburn symptoms should be dark roasted.</p>
