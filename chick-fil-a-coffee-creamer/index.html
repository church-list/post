<p>Inspired me in many ways, including getting my breakfast at cfa irvine marketplace. The flavor of this coleslaw is perfect. Super easy and terrifically scrumptious! Sometimes you don’t know a good thing until it’s gone. For an intense coffee devotee such as myself, this is startling. Not too sweet, not too vinegary…it’s just right.</p>

<p>The flavor of this coleslaw is perfect. Inspired me in many ways, including getting my breakfast at cfa irvine marketplace. When looking over the breakfast menu, i found many high carb foods that would kick me right out of ketosis. Please note that some foods may not be suitable for some people and you are urged to seek the advice of a physician before beginning any weight loss effort or diet regimen. A taco bell coffee with creamer does not contain egg, fish, gluten, milk, msg, peanuts, shellfish, soy, tree nuts or wheat.* * please keep in mind that most fast food restaurants cannot guarantee that any product is free of allergens as they use shared equipment for prepping foods. The chick fil a coleslaw recipe calls for two bags of shredded cabbage and 1/4 cup shredded carrots.</p>
