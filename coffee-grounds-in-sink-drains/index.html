<p>Some employees big into gardening took the bags of used coffee grounds for compost. Well, that only works with instant coffee. With time, the grounds can build up inside your sink drains, creating clogs that can prohibit the drains from doing their job. Dumping coffee grounds in your sink daily will eventually cause a drain blockage. Even though coffee grounds are organic, they can still clog the drain because the small pieces can stick to the inside of the drains. Despite the old wives’ tale that coffee grounds down the sink each day is “good” for the plumbing, we at atomic plumbing are here to tell you the truth:</p>
<h3 id="but-every-day-if-you-keep-dumping-the-entire-contents-of-coffee-grounds-from-your-coffeemaker-down-the-drain-youd-be-wise-to-find-a-good-honest-plumber">But every day, if you keep dumping the entire contents of coffee grounds from your coffeemaker down the drain, you’d be wise to find a good, honest plumber.</h3>
<p>Coffee grounds should always go in the trash can. Plunging the sink step 1. While this can sometimes appear to work rather well, it can actually cause some serious problems with your drain over time. If your sink features a double design, you should seal the other sink drain opening with a rubber sink drain stopper. If you let them down the drain, coffee grounds don’t break down like other foods. They usually clump together and over time, they will build up to a level of blocking the drainage system.</p>
