<p>If you are looking for the healthy coffee creamer which helps in weight loss, it is the great option. Lots of people choose to add sugar or creamer, but the addition of mct oil can really kick your morning beverage into overdrive. Mix it into hot or cold smoothly and evenly with a few stirs of the spoon. Keto coffee (also known as butter coffee and bulletproof coffee) combines coffee and fats to support weight loss for those following low carb diets. Mct oil can make you feel satiated, increase weight loss, and enhance cognition (more on these later). When you take 10 or more grams of mcts, it was found that appetite is suppressed for about 4 hours.</p>
