<p><strong>Caffeine In Dunkin Donuts Coffee Vs Starbucks</strong>. Caffeine (mg) dunkin� donuts coffee with espresso shot : Maybe i’m biased because of my east coast roots, but i swear nothing. New england coffee was best, closely followed by dunkin� donuts and maxwell house. In 2015, a medium dunkin’ decaf had 74 milligrams of caffeine , which is very high for a decaf coffee with about as much caffeine as an espresso shot.</p>

<p>A small iced coffee from dunkin’, which is also 16 ounces, is a whole 66 cents cheaper than a starbucks drink of the same volume. Sipping from two cups, each labeled at the bottom, howard made a definitive and immediate judgment upon trying both: Starbucks came in second with an average of 267 milligrams, mcdonald�s mccafe had 227 milligrams, and dunkin� donuts came in last with 220 milligrams per cup. Which is better for you? 210 mg decaf brewed coffee: Despite this difference in size dunkin still offers cheaper drinks.</p>

<p>Not only did dunkin’ donuts increase the caffeine of their standard brewed coffee to be more inline with coffee establishments such as starbucks, but they also reformulated their decaf. Starbucks is set up to be more open for people to sit down and relax in. Each one a short block away, do i turn right or left? Caffeine (mg) dunkin� donuts coffee with espresso shot : I much prefer starbucks coffee and their food selection.
