<p>Some time ago i published my review of trader joe�s original cold brew coffee concentrate. I was intrigued by the idea of cold brew that was freeze dried into crystals designed to be rehydrated. Of cold water, i figured this coffee must really be potent. It not only scratched that caffeine itch, but it did it in a damn nice way. This is what i assume, but it’s very possible it is a marketing trick. For $3.99 per jar, you actually get a lot of instant coffee and the instructions are simple — just mix a heaping teaspoon of the instant cold brew with 12 oz of cold water, stir and add ice.</p>
