<p>3:1 ratio of water to coffee Let coffee steep at room temperature for 16 to 18 hours. The perfect cold brew press coffee will need to be prepared well in advance, usually at least 12 hours. A cup of cold brew coffee that came from a cold brew batch at 400 grams may contain up to 200 mg of caffeine, while a hot cup of traditional coffee may only contain 170 mg. It is definitely worth doing some experimentation if you. A good rule of thumb is to use a 1:4 coffee to water ratio when making cold brew coffee concentrate.</p>
