<p>It is best to use a metal bowl and place it in the freezer, along with the wire whisk, for at least 15 minutes. The recipe is for a stabilized whipped cream without gelatin. Beat whipping cream, sugar, milk powder, vanilla, and coffee mixture together in a mixing bowl until stiff peaks form. Light, airy, not too sweet and flavored with the just the right amount of coffee, this is the perfect frosting for these cupcakes. Keep cream refrigerated until ready to spread and serve. Meaning the whipped cream won’t lose form and melt away a bit after beating.</p>

<p>Then add the flavoring of your choice. It is deliciously light, soft and so easy to make! Add one packet of instant coffee to whipping cream. Ditch the cool whip and make a batch of homemade whipped cream instead. Stir whipping cream until instant coffee and cocoa powder have completely dissolved. Use as a frosting, a cream filling, or dollop onto your coffee!</p>
