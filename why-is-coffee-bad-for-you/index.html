<p><strong>Why Is Coffee Bad For You</strong>. Caroline chan | may 20, 2019 3:15 pm. Even this morning i wanted that cup of coffee for a moment, one can�t hurt right. Getting used to caffeine decreases your insulin sensitivity, making it difficult for your cells to respond correctly to blood sugar. But i didn�t because i now realise the buzz and ��energy�� it provides is quick and all you end up with is a ton of stress and bad side effects.</p>

<p>The caffeine in coffee is a powerful brain stimulant, which may be a good thing only if you want to increase your alertness in the morning or fuel the second part of your work day. Acid is bad for your teeth. On the other hand, unfiltered coffee —such as turkish coffee, or coffee made with a french press —can increase your ldl (bad) cholesterol levels. Plants and animals naturally produce xanthine. For years, doctors warned people to avoid coffee because it might increase the risk of heart disease and stunt growth. But newer research suggests coffee may actually be good for you—if you follow the rules</p>

<p>Coffee isn�t bad for you, as long as you drink it in moderation. Is coffee good or bad for you? If you are going with a popular creamer like coffee mate, there is usually no cream. Drinking coffee is associated with a drastically reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. Don�t dump out your coffee quite yet.
