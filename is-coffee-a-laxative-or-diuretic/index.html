<p><strong>Is Coffee A Laxative Or Diuretic</strong>. Is coffee a diuretic or laxative? Laxatives are generally taken when a person is. The diuretic effects of caffeine can vary based on many factors, including your sex, activity levels and whether or not you’re used to its effects. After all, most people don’t have to poop after drinking other beverages like soda or energy drinks.</p>

<p>The evidence (and reasoning behind it) is irrefutable: While we’ve been told for years that coffee (and caffeine in general) is a potent diuretic, research studies show that coffee only seems to have diuretic effects when consumed in larger amounts — adding up to more than 500 to 600 mg of caffeine a day. With excess urination, the body fluid gets drained out, resulting in dehydration. But caffeine can also have a laxative effect in some particularly sensitive people. High intake of boiled, unfiltered coffee has been associated with mild increase in cholesterol levels. But does decaf coffee have this same laxative effect, or is the effect worse due to the chemical differences in decaf coffee?</p>
<h3 id="in-fact-one-study-alludes-to-the-prospect-of-it-having-an-even-more-significant-influence-on-our-bowels">In fact, one study alludes to the prospect of it having an even more significant influence on our bowels.</h3>
<p>A small 2005 study involving 16 participants showed no differences in the force of contractions in the rectum 45 minutes after. Coffee is a good fix. However, drinking 5 or 6 cups of coffee with milk can have the opposite effect. Drinking coffee may help regulate a person�s bowel movements. Coffee has a mild diuretic action, which means that it can cause increased urination. For most people, the caffeine in coffee is simply a mild diuretic, which makes the body excrete more liquid.</p>
