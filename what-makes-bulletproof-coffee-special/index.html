I make a special bulletproof coffee with coffee from longevity or i did get some from dave’s bulletproof site for christmas and i froth homemade almond milk with my espresso machine with heaping teaspoon of coconut oil or xct oil, then i blend my shot of coffee with a heaping tablespoon of jing city and a squirt of butterscotch toffee stevia. Coffee grinder — i use this little guy from hario!.
