<p>My first instinct is to say it�s just well marketed robusta beans. People at death wish coffee have found a coffee bean with close to 200% more caffeine than your typical coffee shop coffee. Both of our death wish and valhalla blends are usda certified organic and fair trade with no additives or ingredients beyond the organic coffee beans, our blend has only about two calories per cup, no carbs, protein, or fiber. Deathwish coffee had samples of their coffee tested at emsl food chemistry lab in 2015. Honestly, it’s an inconsequential argument to me. So, if caffeine is your thing, fasten your seatbelts, because you’ve come to the right place.</p>
