<p><strong>Growing Coffee Plants From Seed</strong>. Chances are you live outside of the coffee growing belt. Prepare the soil for planting. If you’re growing the tree in the hopes of producing your own coffee beans, choose an arabica coffee. They can be pruned if needed, either by pinching or cutting.</p>

<p>Coffee plants grow well in containers. A mature coffee plant is capable of producing up to 10 pounds. Ideally, to grow coffee bean plants, you should start with a freshly picked coffee cherry, but most of us don’t live in a coffee producing country, so this is a bit problematic. When it comes to seed treatment before sowing, azospirillum and phosphobacterium can be applied for this purpose. Use moist vermiculite in damp coffee sacks, burlap bags or polythene bags. The humidity around the plant will need to stay high as well.</p>
<h3 id="coffee-beans-are-the-seed-part-of-the-tropical-native-coffee-tree">Coffee beans are the seed part of the tropical native coffee tree.</h3>
<p>Prune the growing tip to encourage side branching. The humidity around the plant will need to stay high as well. Coffea genus includes over 120 species that are grown from seed. Prune your coffee plant once it reaches a height of 2 feet. When dried, roasted and ground, it’s used to brew coffee. The following guide is intended to show you one method for growing coffee seeds.</p>
