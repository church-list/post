<p>On hot days esp during summer, cold coffee will not only cool you down but also you also get your dosage of caffeine to power you through the day. Spoon your instant coffee grounds into the middle of the filter and pour very hot water over it slowly. More than half the population in this world start their day with coffee. Measure out your medium to coarse grounds (coarse are better) at a 1:4 or 1:5 coffee to water ratio in your french press. Combine boiling water and coffee crystals in pitcher. If using skimmed milk or low fat milk, then just reduce the ¼ cup water to about 2 to 3 tbsp.</p>
