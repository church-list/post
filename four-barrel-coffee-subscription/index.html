<p>Four barrel coffee (valencia) mission district; Each batch of this unique craft coffee is roasted by the smoldering breath of dragons and flavored to order with mythical unicorn magic. Haven�t tried four barrel in a while so i picked up a bag of beans to brew at home and i�ve gotta say i�m just not feelin� it. I know a guy who roasts and sells as a hobby and i buy most of my coffee from him. Pamphlets on the bar counter. Four barrel coffee’s roasting philosophy is humble as well, favoring individual, experienced artisans in lieu of complicated machinery.</p>
