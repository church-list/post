<p>Coffee also lowers the risk of other liver conditions including fibrosis (scar tissue that builds up within the liver) and cirrhosis Even in countries with very high intake of caffeine from coffee, such as scandinavian countries, research does not support a link between coffee or caffeine and cancer risk. But there are a few things that you should consider when preparing it in order to make sure that it remains a safe, healthy beverage and won’t be turned into something bad for your liver. Back in 2005, research published in the journal of the national cancer institute found a relationship between drinking coffee and a reduced risk of liver cancer. When newer studies adjusted for such factors, they found a possible association between coffee and decreased mortality. Drinking more coffee might help reduce the kind of liver damage that’s associated with overindulging in food and alcohol, a review of existing studies suggests.</p>

<p>Coffee is actually considered beneficial to the liver. For example, a 2004 study reported in harvard women�s health found that coffee may help reduce the risk of liver damage in those people with a high risk for liver disease 1. The findings suggest that coffee drinking versus no coffee consumption is associated with a 40 percent reduction in liver cancer risk. Coffee drinkers have up to a 40% lower risk of liver cancer (29, 30). And conversely, some studies have found that certain other cancer types are less common in coffee drinkers, in particular liver cancer. Coffee reduces the risk of liver and endometrial cancers, with limited evidence indicating the potential to reduce risk of mouth, pharynx, larynx, and certain skin cancers.</p>
