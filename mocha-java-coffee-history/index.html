<p><strong>Mocha Java Coffee History</strong>. In olden days, coffee beans from yemen—where coffee has grown since the 15 th century (see world�s best history of coffee )—were shipped in the wooden hulls of sailing ships of sailors at the great yemen port of mocha [mokha]. This coffee is prized as one component in the traditional mocha java blend, which pairs coffee from yemen and java. How did colonialism influence diffusion? In fact, jamoke was a common slang term for coffee in the 1930s and may have been a shortened version of java and mocha referring to the coffee’s origins.</p>
