<p>Keto coffee (bulletproof coffee) is an energizing alternative to traditional coffee drinks that helps people on a ketogenic diet reach and maintain a state of ketosis.

The kind made the bulletproof® way with tested bulletproof® coffee beans, grassfed butter and xct or brain octane oil. I’m one of the people doing a lot of that talking! Avoid consuming the “kryptonite” foods as much as you can. Stick to bulletproof intermittent fasting on most days by consuming your lunch and dinner in a span of not more than 6 hours. I mean can putting butter and brain octane oil in your coffee really give you a huge boost in energy?</p>
