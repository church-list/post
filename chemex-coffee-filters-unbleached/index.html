<p><strong>Chemex Coffee Filters Unbleached</strong>. They have been specifically designed to give balanced performance with the chemex coffeemaker. These filters are specifically designed to fit in chemex brewers of all sizes. Just add coffee, cold water and let. I already own the unbleached filters, but never have tried the bleached ones before until a friend gave me a few to try out.</p>
