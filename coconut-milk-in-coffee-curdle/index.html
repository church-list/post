Heat melts it, so if you hate lumps, go with hot low fat coconut milk will lump less, but low fat coconut milk is missing the best part you can freeze some coconut milk into hard ice cubes and shake with cold black coffee, not quite the same but not lumpy. It’s full of healthy fats, vitamins. To prevent large curds from forming when you cook coconut milk, ‘stir often’ does the trick.</p>

<p>Kare — sunday, june 5, 2016 @ 7:36 am reply. Most dairy milk products made from cow milk or buffalo milk easily get curdled when added in the hot brewed coffee. Waiting for my coffee to cool. Similarly, warm milk helps bacteria thrive and also increases the rate of the clumping reaction. After some time, depending on how badly curdled the milk is, the clumps will separate and blend back into the liquid. Coconut milk is made by peeling and shredding the nut�s meat, and then steeping it in very hot water.</p>
