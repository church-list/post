<p>Before getting to the review itself, let me say a little about the coffee and where it comes from. Koking wrote a review mar 2020. There is a small parking lot out front. Mauigrown coffee is the grower of 100% maui origin coffee at the ka‘anapali estate. From the maui farm to your door. Later in the day i drove through their fields.</p>

<p>As always, we ground the beans just before brewing, made a small cup of black coffee and then waited for two or three minutes to let it cool before tasting.</p>
