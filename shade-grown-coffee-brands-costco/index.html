<p>Coffees from colombia, brazil and costa rica are more likely to be “sun” coffees, although there are some shade producers from these regions. Organic coffee is grown without the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, on land that has had a sufficient amount of time to detoxify itself from any chemicals or modified organisms. Acres upon acres of coffee bushes planted in hedgelike rows are sustained by fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation. To ensure that farmers and the environment are protected in their search for the world’s best beans, they roast exclusively 100% certified organic, fair trade, and shade. Volcanic rich soil packed with nutritious minerals, plus the natural leaf litter from the naturally occurring bird friendly shade trees, makes our 100% organic shadegrown coffee the preferred coffee of many coffee drinkers, all while conserving the rainforest. Find a great collection of kirkland signature ground coffee at costco.</p>

Organic coffee is grown without the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, on land that has had a sufficient amount of time to detoxify itself from any chemicals or modified organisms. It’s only grown in all natural, organic soil. This is an exception to costco�s return policy.
