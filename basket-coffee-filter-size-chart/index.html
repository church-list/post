<p>The high quality, thicker paper is what sets melitta’s basket filters apart from the average store brand; A triple basket is the name given to a basket that can accept more than 21 grams of coffee. Size of filter paper the correct size of filter to use is dictated by the size of the filter holder within your coffeemaker. Ristenpart tells me that a lot of this comes down to flow rate. They�re offered in a pack of 200 premium filters and are available in multiple pack counts for added convenience. In each case, the shape of the filter and filter basket affect how long the water takes to pass through the coffee.</p>
