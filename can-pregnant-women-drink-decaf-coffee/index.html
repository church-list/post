<p><strong>Can Pregnant Women Drink Decaf Coffee</strong>. Studies have shown that women who drink a “moderate” amount of caffeinated beverages while pregnant have an increased risk of miscarriages. It�s true that in the past, pregnant women were advised to avoid coffee and other forms of caffeine entirely, but newer research has found that moderate amounts are safe, as long as you take a few precautions. The process of decaf coffee starts by immersing green coffee beans in the water that softens them and also dissolves caffeine content. 100% caffeine free coffee is not possible.</p>
