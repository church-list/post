<p>Concurrently, a field trial grew the same plants under six treatments: Some indicate using it in compost, others suggest spreading it and broken eggshells as an insect deterrent, and others recommend making a tea (heh!) out of it to water plants. Another study showed that compost made with coffee grounds was actually richer in nutrients than regular food wastes. Literature on coffee grounds compiled by dr. A batch of 40% coffee grounds and 60% other organic matter produced the fewest greenhouse gasses and highest quality compost. Coffee grounds encourage the growth of microorganisms in the soil, which use nitrogen for their growth and reproduction.</p>
