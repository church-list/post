<p>Grab a tea or coffee. “yet you are holy, dwelling in the praises of israel.” (psalm 22:3) when you think about how to start a prayer journal, a natural starting place is praise to god. It will slow you down and helps you focus on the bible passages in a new way. It’s meant to be something you desire to do. Then, i slip on a comfy robe or sweater and try to quietly sneak off into the kitchen without waking anyone. From genesis to revelation we read of normal people that received the promises of god.</p>
<h3 id="i-cant-think-straight-and-i-forget-what-im-supposed-to-be-doing">I can’t think straight and i forget what i’m supposed to be doing.</h3>
<p>These promises are sealed by the highest authority, god’s word. Coffee has a very positive effect on the prayer life of the believer. Having the time to get your composure right will let you reflect first before writing what you want to talk to god about. This is perfect for your ladies’ group, small group, bible study gals, or teens and tweens! As my coffee brews i take out my bible, prayer binder and colored pens. This prayer journal is a basic online version of our original hard copy prayer journal.</p>
