From the beginning, it bragged about offering the “world’s finest coffee,” upping its game with the introduction of. In my opinion a fresh, hot cup of mcdonalds smooth coffee is hard to beat (especially at 69 cents)? In terms of caffeine, tim hortons dark roast is not as strong as the original blend.</p>
