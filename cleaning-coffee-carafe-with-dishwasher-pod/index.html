<p><strong>Cleaning Coffee Carafe With Dishwasher Pod</strong>. I tried cleaning the carafe with a pod 2 days ago. Place the coffee pot into the sink and put a dishwasher pod such as cascade into the carafe. Rinse everything out by putting in a new paper filter and brewing a full pot of clean water. It only takes about 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Recently i found a video on using dishwasher pods, so i decided to give it a try. Even simpler than the last one, you put your coffee pot in the sink (so you don’t spill any boiling water on your nice kitchen. Kind of a very strong chemical lemon smell. I tried cleaning the carafe with a pod 2 days ago. Cleaning the coffee pot every day with soap and water will help to prevent difficult stains that can build up over time. It only takes about 30 minutes.</p>

<p>When you notice discoloration or stains, keep in mind that a little is just part of the moka coffee experience. Then, turn the coffee maker back on, finish the brewing, and dump the full pot of vinegar and water. The drip tray can collect a lot of excess coffee and become a haven for germs. While the coffee maker is partially disassembled, use a small cleaning brush dipped in vinegar to clean around the base of the machine where the reservoir is and in the area surrounding where the pod/cup goes (i’m not the only one with lots of grounds trapped in there, am i?). Cleaning the coffee pot every day with soap and water will help to prevent difficult stains that can build up over time. Only cleaning the carafe… the biggest mistake people make when cleaning their coffee pot is only cleaning the carafe.</p>
