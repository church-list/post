<p><strong>Water Processed Decaf Coffee Beans</strong>. Contrary to popular belief, no decaf coffee is 100% decaffeinated, nor is any decaf tea to come from camellia sinensis plant. In this step, the carbon dioxide acts as a solvent and removes the caffeine from the coffee beans. This process ensures the beans are guaranteed to be 99.9% caffeine free. The swiss water decaffeination process removes more than 97% of caffeine, but the coffee retains its strong flavor without the bitterness.</p>
