<p>Since making a latte is all about the coffee, milk, and pouring through the crema, it�s safe to assume our iced latte maker should first make excellent espresso. Although your local coffee shop makes it look like a science, i have confidence that if i can do this, you can too. Blend with 50ml milk and a couple of handfuls of ice. If you want, you can add a flavor syrup to the milk and coffee mixture to make a flavored drink. Combine the prepared espresso, sweetener, half and half, milk, and ice cubes in a blender. It�s super simple and doesn�t require any fancy equipment.</p>
