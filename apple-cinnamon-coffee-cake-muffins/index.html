<p>In a large mixing bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, and salt. They have the classic sour cream coffee cake base, notes of warm cinnamon, grated granny smith apple, a crumbly brown sugar oat streusel topping and a drizzle of vanilla glaze on top. Chop the pie filling into smaller apple chunks. Pieces of tender apples and walnuts in every bite, plus a delicious streusel topping. I’m always trying to outdo myself with coffee cakes. While the muffins are baking, i usually begin to brew a cup of coffee for me and take the time to talk to my kids.</p>

<p>Happy first day of fall! Originating from germany, these cakes were meant to be eaten early in the day with your coffee but i think they are perfect any time of day. After trying it on these coffee cake muffins, be sure to try my pear muffins with crumbly cinnamon topping next. In another small bowl, beat sour cream, melted butter, eggs and vanilla with whisk until blended. Besides gorgeous sunny summer days, perfect for swimming… this is probably my happiest time of the pandemic so far. However i made some changes over time for a healthier version.</p>
