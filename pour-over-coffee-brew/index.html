<p><strong>Pour Over Coffee Brew</strong>. Try to pour quickly, gently, and evenly across the surface of the coffee, pausing between pours to pace your brew to your target brew time (see below). Baristas make pour over coffee look so effortless. To make a pour over coffee we require freshly ground coffee powder, a filter holder with a filter called the pour over dripper. You’ll just have to carefully control those essential elements of proper brewing.</p>

<p>What is the pour over? The technique has been commonly used in europe since the 1900s and elsewhere for much longer, but was “rediscovered” by the specialty coffee movement in recent years. It also happens to be our favorite way to make coffee at. Just tear open the filter inside the sachet, place the filter over a cup and pour hot water evenly to brew an instant yet invigorating cup of coffee. Keep a slow and even pour, moving in concentric circles from the center outward (up to ~¼” from the edge of the brewer). To make a pour over coffee we require freshly ground coffee powder, a filter holder with a filter called the pour over dripper.</p>

<p>But if you have an inconsistent grind, pour over will just highlight that with an inconsistent brew. On a simple tone, pour over coffee require pouring the hot water over the freshly ground coffee beans, to allow the water to capture the coffee flavors and take it to your cup or the coffee jug. The bloom pour saturates all of the grounds and will help later with an even extraction. The pour over is a funny thing. Set up your brewing equipment and boil your filtered water. Remove the pour over and serve the coffee.</p>
