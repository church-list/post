<p><strong>Flavored Coffee Grounds Recipes</strong>. We are looking to try to flavor our own freshly ground beans. As hot water is filtered through the grounds, the flavor of the spices will be extracted into your cup. Add the additional ingredient to the basic mix before adding water. 1/3 cup ground coffee (not instant coffee granules) 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon or other spice.</p>

<p>Some of my friends use caramel or fudge ice cream syrup in their coffee. Baileys hot coffee brew up a cup of your favorite coffee and then make it extra special with a splash of baileys original irish cream.
