<p>I started with building a storage side table that goes as a set with this coffee table. These free coffee table plans will help you build a wonderful centerpiece for your living room that looks great and is very functional. So, a coffee table that doubles as cushion storage was born. I’m partnering with my friends over at build something to bring you the tutorial for this project today. This month’s theme on ryobi nation is hidden gems and i have just the project in mind. This week i’m fixing that by building a coffee table that has storage inside.</p>

<p>These free coffee table plans will help you build a wonderful centerpiece for your living room that looks great and is very functional. Buying a new coffee table can be a tiring process. It has a draw on one side for all brayden’s toys and a drawer on the other side for our blankets and such. Or, you can paint or stain a wooden pallet and attach it to 4 legs for an easy, simple coffee table design. I was thinking about building one of those tables where the top actually lifts up and turns into a surface to eat on (while sitting on the couch) but we actually never eat in the living room so i figured i would stick with a more traditional style of having a hinged. I built the table with a hinged top so i could store the cushions inside, out of archer’s reach, when not in use and then easily pull them out when needed.</p>
