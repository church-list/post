<p>High altitude coffee grown at 5,000ft (1500m) coffee grown at around 5,000 feet (1500m) is known as very high altitude coffee. Because there is less oxygen, the plants grow more slowly giving the beans a more concentrated flavor. Coffee quality is often graded in part by altitude. The influence of geography on the flavor of a coffee bean is profound. The flavors imparted in these beans are fruity, spicy, floral, and even reminiscent of wine. So those were the 3 main reasons high altitude coffee is better.</p>

In mountain valleys such as antigua, guatemala, temperatures can plummet at night. Arabica beans grow in high altitudes and have a wider spectrum of taste. Robusta coffee beans can grow at sea level, are higher in caffeine, and taste harsher than arabica beans.</p>
