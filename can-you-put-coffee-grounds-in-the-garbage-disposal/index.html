<p><strong>Can You Put Coffee Grounds In The Garbage Disposal</strong>. I hate getting rid of the grounds from my french press, so i�ve done a bit of online research. A few things can happen when coffee drains are put down the drain or are used to “clean” the disposer. Pretty much everything we just said about coffee grounds above also applies to eggshells. As a bonus, coffee grounds can absorb odors, so they might help keep your trash from smelling bad.</p>

<p>The first couple times i cleaned my french press, i just rinsed it out in the sink and let all the grounds go down, but after doing some research on whether this was good for the disposal or not i found that it really can be a problem for your pipes. Can you put coffee grounds down the drain? Despite all that, they should never be put into your sink. Instead, dump your french press into a strainer over the sink, then empty the strainer into a garbage or compost bin. Eggshells, shellfish, and coffee grounds. These can pile up over time if you continuously dump coffee grounds into your disposal, which inevitably will stop up your pipes and cause slow drainage.</p>
