<p>I think adding vinyl to a mug for a custom gift is a great idea, but i struggle with putting it on straight‚Ä¶until now! And in 99% of these cases, the vinyl was sealed. I used to hand paint them, but that takes a lot of time, and hoped using vinyl decals would be easier. Whether itÔøΩs vinyl, accessories, craft cutters, or inspiration, craftables has it all! Then position the vinyl design on your mug, using the scraper tool again to really stick the vinyl letters to the mug. Previously, i put vinyl on some mason jar mugs that were used as party favours for my son‚Äôs birthday party.</p>

<p>It has been put in the dishwasher almost daily and still has most of the vinyl on it. I say mostly, because like the 2nd or 3rd day he had it at his office, somebody stole the dot from the small i in his name. Well, we‚Äôve got a solution for that too. And in 99% of these cases, the vinyl was sealed. And most of my favorite drinks involve mugs‚Ä¶ so it‚Äôs only natural that i‚Äôd combine the two pretty frequently. To seal vinyl decals on mugs, simply cover the entire mug with some dishwasher safe mod podge.</p>
