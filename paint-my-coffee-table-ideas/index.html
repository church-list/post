<p>The dipped look is a great way to introduce a strong color without completely committing to a shade. This gorgeous one with chalk paint. After the two coats of black chalk paint were dry, i did a little sanding. But let me tell you when i first saw this table, all i saw was a beat up table that i wasn’t sure was worth saving. This first table is painted in a chalk paint color, olive. Apply a natural furniture oil, like tung oil, teak oil, or danish oil, to a clean cloth.</p>

<p>We have just held on to it because i can’t seem to find just the right piece. Black furniture paint and black wood stain go together like peas and carrots.black furniture is both timeless and one of the easier painted furniture finishes to achieve. After the two coats of black chalk paint were dry, i did a little sanding. I have wanted a coffee table in our living room that would look good with our vintage general store counter.the counter has a white chippy wonderful look and i knew the only way i could find something to match it was to make it myself with milk paint.so i reached out to old barn milk paint and they were kind enough to send me some of their products to try out. But let me tell you when i first saw this table, all i saw was a beat up table that i wasn’t sure was worth saving. I would love to find out about featuring it in your awesome coffee table area.</p>
