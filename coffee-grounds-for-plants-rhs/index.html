<p>Coffee grounds ðŸŒ¶ instead of disposing of coffee grounds only in the bin, you can do something useful with it. The caffeine in coffee has indeed been found to keep slugs and snails at bay and spent coffee can also be used as a mulch or to improve compost. Many of us will have dumped the cold remains of a forgotten coffee in a plant pot at some point, and then perhaps wondered if it was the wrong thing to do! Iâ€™ve long been familiar with the idea of putting coffee around plants to deter slugs (they donâ€™t like the grainy nature of them, and they find the caffeine toxic), but had never heard of coffee. Furthermore, their abrasiveness makes them a great cleaning scrub around the house. The good news is that the coffee grounds improved the water holding capacity of the soil and decreased weed growth.</p>
<h3 id="one-research-study-found-that-using-spent-coffee-grounds-in-growing-broccoli-leek-radish-viola-and-sunflower-resulted-in-poorer-growth-in-all-soil-types-with-or-without-additional-fertilizer">One research study found that using spent coffee grounds in growing broccoli, leek, radish, viola, and sunflower resulted in poorer growth in all soil types, with or without additional fertilizer.</h3>
<p>You can sprinkle it in the soil or add it to the watering water. If you rinse your used coffee grounds, they will have a near neutral ph of 6.5 and will not affect the acid levels of the soil.

Whatever youâ€™re gardening issue is, it seems coffee can fix it. The caffeine in coffee has indeed been found to keep slugs and snails at bay and spent coffee can also be used as a mulch or to improve compost.</p>
