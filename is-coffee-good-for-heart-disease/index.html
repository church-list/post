<p><strong>Is Coffee Good For Heart Disease</strong>. And drinking more than five cups of coffee per day didn. Earlier this a year, a study published in the american journal of clinical nutrition found that people who drink six or more cups of coffee. Explanations for the association between coffee consumption and lower rates of heart disease and diabetes often point to chlorogenic acid and other obscure antioxidant substances as the responsible parties. Perhaps that�s why it�s been blamed for innumerable woes.</p>

<p>The team suggests that p27 is likely the reason why caffeine administration can help after heart attack, and that caffeine may even be protective for people at higher risk for heart disease. In the new study, moderate coffee drinkers (those who consumed two or three cups a day) raised their risk of having a heart attack by 60% by drinking a cup of coffee. Just make it a good one and take the time to enjoy it. Coffee was said to increase blood pressure, increase cholesterol levels, and increase the risk of heart attack and cardiac arrhythmias. More specifically, habitual coffee drinking has been linked to a lower risk of coronary heart disease in women. In fact, one recent study connected coffee to heart disease.</p>

<p>The study, published in the american journal of clinical nutrition, suggests that drinking six or more cups of coffee per day may increase your risk of heart disease by up to 22%. Perhaps that�s why it�s been blamed for innumerable woes. Above four to five cups, the size of the risk decrease (that is, the benefit) tended to get smaller. Compared with unfiltered coffee, filtered coffee was associated with a lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, ischemic heart disease or stroke. A dutch study followed 37,514 participants over 13 years with 1,387 cases of coronary heart disease. Coffee’s potential benefits go beyond the heart.</p>
