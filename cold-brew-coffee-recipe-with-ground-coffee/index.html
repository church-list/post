<p><strong>Cold Brew Coffee Recipe With Ground Coffee</strong>. A cold brew coffee maker is necessary for two simple reasons.

(the longer the coffee sits, the stronger the flavor.) strain the coffee through a fine mesh sieve; Cold brew vs iced coffee. Pour hot water over the grounds; 2) filter out the coffee grounds.</p>

Cold brew coffee is made by steeping coarsely ground coffee beans in water. 2) filter out the coffee grounds.
