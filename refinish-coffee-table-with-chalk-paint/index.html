<p><strong>Refinish Coffee Table With Chalk Paint</strong>. The process is simple, quick, and fun. Sanding the surface of a table top is far easier than sanding the spindled legs of the table, so i gladly grabbed my hand sander. Since we spend a lot of time in the family room, we need to have a very functional space. Then came time for the legs and lower shelf of the coffee table.</p>

<p>Normally when we refinish a table and use chalk paint, there is no need to sand. The process is simple, quick, and fun. This is a fun diy project i completed last fall season, and i wanted to put together a full post with tips on how to use chalk paint and my diy chalk paint table experience in the hopes that it would help others. Lots of empty walls, and lots of old furniture from my old house that i wanted to make fit into my new house with a little more pizzazz. So i responded to a couple online ads for used coffee tables, and found two similar, french provincial style coffee tables that i was interested in. How to use chalk paint i like the look of wood on my table top.</p>

<p>After that, apply a new finish like furniture oil, wood stain, varnish, or paint that will give the coffee table the final look you want. So, i decided to paint the table. However, this table top was in such rough shape that if we did not sand the top, all of the divets would have stuck out like a sore thumb. Not only did it need to be a different color to match my decor, but it was all scuffed up and in need of a new life!

<p>The coffee table is one of the highlights of my living room, but with all of the nail polish remover spills, stains and scratches from the previous owner, and general wear and tear i decided it was time for a new finish and a new look.</p>

<p>I used a very rough grit sandpaper (80) with a medium to light touch, and went to work sanding off the white chalk paint layer on the parts of the table i thought would wear naturally with age (like the corners of the legs and top).</p>
