<p><strong>Kitchen Microwave And Coffee Station</strong>. No need to go out for your morning cup anymore! You can set up a counter top coffee and tea station, use a bar cart, or create a hot beverage station in a kitchen cabinet. When situating your coffee pot, make sure there’s adequate clearance to access all of its features. A nicely trimmed out microwave works great in a space like this if you don�t find yourself using it too frequently.</p>

<p>Since we drink tea daily, i set a tea organizer with assorted teas on the kitchen counter and keep a tea pot on the stove. Floor to ceiling blue kitchen cabinets are fitted with a microwave drawer and a hidden coffee station, while b2 vapor counter stools sit at a white island finished with a stainless steel sink and a polished nickel gooseneck faucet fixed to a white quartz countertop. 4.8 out of 5 stars 1,861. I hope you will find inspiration to set up an inviting coffee station for yourself and guests. You may as well store a blender and fresh fruit in here. If you’re especially opposed to countertop clutter (or your surface is limited enough as is) carve a coffee nook inside your cabinets.</p>
