<p><strong>What Is Medium Dark Roast Coffee</strong>. In order for the green seeds to turn into the brown beans that we know, they undergo chemical and physical transformations: There is a popular myth that dark roasted coffee beans will eventually have higher caffeine than light roast. The flavor of the roasting process overshadows the bean’s origin flavor completely as it gets darker because of the roasting process. Whether you’re just starting to dabble in darker coffees or you′ve already found your sweet spot on the spectrum, count on these blends for consistently delicious flavors and aromas every time.</p>

<h3 id="in-medium-roast-some-flavor-notes-are-still-there-but-with-a-more-toasted-flavor-that-may-also-have-a-little-bitterness">In medium roast, some flavor notes are still there, but with a more toasted flavor that may also have a little bitterness.</h3>
<p>Medium roast coffee is a brown color and rarely has an oily surface. And roast level (meaning making it dark or light or medium) is just one of the many ways these these professional coffee roasters can affect the taste of the coffee, he says, among other factors. Dark roasts have a hallmark aroma familiar to most, of a varying intensity dependent on the specific coffee roasted and the degree of darkness. Full city plus roast adds more intensity to the medium roast. The beans are roasted to the beginning or middle of the second crack — about 225°c (437°f) or 230°c (446°f). Medium dark is that magical spot where the flavor and aroma of the roasting process just begins to become noticeable.</p>
