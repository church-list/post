<p>You can still find chicory coffee in new orleans at places like the iconic cafe du monde and you can usually find a blend or two in most grocery stores. The young leaves, when used for salad, are called endive. Measure 1 tablespoon chicory coffee blend to 1 cup water (a little less next time if it’s too strong). This indian blend has no additives and no artificial flavorings. I find this to be most delicious and i�m very happy with this product. ( 4.6 ) out of 5 stars 108 ratings , based on 108 reviews current price $8.78 $ 8.</p>
