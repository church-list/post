<p><strong>Keep Coffee Hot At Desk</strong>. As water crosses the beans, it extracts oils and flavors, cooling down slightly before dripping into the carafe. At some point, youï¿½re going to reach for that freshly made java and itï¿½ll be lukewarm. I like to keep a mug of hot tea or coffee on my desk while working, and for many years i was seeking a practical way to keep my drink at at least 62Â°c for an hour or more. The mug is made with durable bpa free materials and has a wide base keeping your coffee safe from being spilled in case it gets accidentally tipped over.</p>
