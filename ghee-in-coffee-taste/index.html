<p><strong>Ghee In Coffee Taste</strong>. Bulletproof ghee is an excellent source of vitamins, minerals, and acids geared to protect your body, improve digestion, and help you lose weight. Ghee can be used like any other cooking fat, but using it as a finishing oil really allows that rich, grassy flavor to come through. Adding ghee won’t give the coffee drinkers such commotion. If you find the flavor a bit strong for your liking, stick to using your ghee in curries or other highly flavored dishes rather than spreading it on toast or baked goods.</p>

However, ghee does have a slightly nutty taste, which may alter the flavor of your dish — but not necessarily in a bad way. Ghee also has a higher smoke rate than butter so can be a more bulletproof cooking oil.</p>
