<p>If you don’t really like your americano hot, you can always make your own iced americano. In a home setting, however, i�m more lenient with how long i keep it stored. If you love espresso, then you’ll enjoy this cold coffee drink. Same taste, none of the heat *barista device may not be available in your country. Americano is wildly popular in north america, and luckily it’s actually very simple to make. Consider making an iced americano.</p>

<p>We are getting into the hot season here and this cool thirst quenching drink will be back on our daily routine. I am especially sharing this recipe for those coffee lovers who are trying to cut sugar and maintain their weight this year. Pour the room temperature or chilled coffee into the glass. Brewed iced coffee is fine to store in the fridge, but it will start to lose quality. This “cold brew method” will yield a large amount of espresso that will keep fresh for at least a week. For a seasonal switch, try an iced americano.</p>
