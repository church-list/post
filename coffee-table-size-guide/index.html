<p><strong>Coffee Table Size Guide</strong>. End of table to end of table (one person seated by the shorter side (end) in one of the tables): In spite of following the ways correctly to make coffee, you may fail again and again to find out the solution. Allow 24″ to 30″ between the coffee table and tv stand. That’ll leave enough room on both ends.</p>

<p>Coffee table sizes finding the perfect coffee table size for your space can be difficult, but following a principal guideline can help. The average height of a coffee table is anywhere from 16 to 20 inches, and usually somewhere in between since the height of most seat cushions on sofas and loveseats is about 18 inches. There is a little leeway, as the table can be 1 to 2 inches shorter, although it should never be higher than the sofa. Generally, the standard height of the coffee tables is between sixteen to eighteen inches. The best size of your coffee table depends on the size of your sofa. Some homeowners utilize these tables to rest coffee and magazines or eat meals.</p>
<h3 id="to-allow-for-easy-maneuvering-around-your-coffee-table-we-recommend-leaving-between-12-and-18-of-space-between-the-coffee-table-and-the-sofa">To allow for easy maneuvering around your coffee table, we recommend leaving between 12 and 18 of space between the coffee table and the sofa.</h3>
<p>Think about how you’ll use your coffee table on a daily basis. Your coffee table should be at least half the length of your sofa (but no more than roughly ⅔ the length) and should sit at about the same height as the seat, give. That’ll leave enough room on both ends. To allow for easy maneuvering around your coffee table, we recommend leaving between 12 and 18 of space between the coffee table and the sofa. To ensure comfortable foot traffic around the rest of your living room, we also recommend leaving 30 of space between the coffee table and other pieces of furniture, like a tv stand or entertainment center. The standard seat height for a sofa or futon is between 19 and 21 inches, so your ideal coffee table height may vary depending on your sofa.</p>
