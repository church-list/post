<p><strong>Coffee Spill On Wool Carpet</strong>. If the coffee and cream spill is fresh, grab a dry cloth or paper towel and begin by blotting the spill. For solids use a blunt knife or spoon. Often these stains can be permenant. In case you have a wool blend or a wool carpet, then make sure that you add a little ammonia to the water you pour on the stain (one tbsp ammonia to 1 cup water), or you can ask professional carpet cleaners for advice.</p>
