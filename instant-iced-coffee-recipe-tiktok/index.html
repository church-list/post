<p>This fluffy caffeinated beverage consists of instant coffee, sugar and milk, and gained notoriety from tiktok tutorials requiring you to whip the drink 400 times until you get that whipped cream. Pour ice and milk into a cup, and top with the whipped coffee mixture. I think it�s awsome, but a litte tip of variation for iced cap lovers: Tiktok is rife with innovative recipes and foodie techniques, so we’ve collated a few of our favourite iced coffee videos that we’ll be trying at home this weekend. The real art is in the method. 1 cup milk of choice.</p>
<h3 id="add-the-coffee-sugar-and-boiling-water-in-a-bowl">Add the coffee, sugar and boiling water in a bowl.</h3>
<p>I’ve already drank 3 of these today and i can feel my heartbeat in my feet. Instead of putting the coffee and milk mixture in a glass of ice, blend it in with the ice in a blender, if you have an ice breaker. 1 cup milk of choice. Put two tablespoons of instant coffee, two tablespoons of granulated sugar, and two tablespoons of hot water in a small bowl. But the majority of us are now being introduced to it thanks to a tikkok sensation recently taking the internet by storm. Soon i was able to make a beautiful, creamy iced coffee with my own tiktok coffee recipe.</p>
