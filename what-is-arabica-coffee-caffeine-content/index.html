<p>Robusta vs arabica caffeine content: From a price perspective, green. The higher caffeine content comes from steeping the grounds for an extended period of time (our recipe calls for 12 hours of immersion).

As mentioned here, arabica contains almost 60% more lipids and almost twice the concentration of sugar than robusta.</p>
