<p><strong>How To Make Coffee Foam Art At Home</strong>. For the coffee pros, tackle the most intricate, ornate and original cups of 3d foamy art. Steamed milk that creates a bit of foam on the top, so it’s not complicated in itself, but there are tons of great ways to spice things up with a creative art design, and put a smile on someone’s face.

At home, i would use a small measuring cup with a spout (or ideally a latte art pitcher). We love to sit inside on a chilly day with a hot, frothy latte or cappuccino.

Start the pour a little high until the cup is nearly half full, and then lower the pour so it’s close to the crema to make the foam appear.
