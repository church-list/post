<p><strong>How To Make Real Cowboy Coffee</strong>. We’re talking about instant coffee. Pour 2 full cups of ground coffee into pot with water up to half way in spout. Pinch off some dough, form a ball, and roll it in melted shortening. As the name suggests, the cowboys used this method because it was simple, lightweight and convenient for travel.</p>

<p>You want the water temperature to reach approximately 200 degrees which is the optimum temperature to brew coffee. Add the grounds to the kettle and stir for about 15 seconds. Simply put some cracked and washed eggshells in the coffee pot when adding coffee grounds to the water. Let this brew for about 5 minutes. Also called camping coffee, the brew can be prepared at home on the stovetop, but it really comes into its own when you make it on an open fire using a simple metal can. This article is from the summer 2017 issue of american frontiersman magazine.</p>
<h3 id="let-them-stay-in-the-pot-while-brewing-and-pouring-your-coffee">Let them stay in the pot while brewing and pouring your coffee.</h3>
<p>As the water reaches a rolling boil, drop the eggshell into the pot. Add coffee grounds to a pot of water (about 1 tablespoon per cup of coffee) bring it to a boil (usually over a campfire) continue boiling for a few minutes; Place flour in a bowl and add the sourdough starter. I was told one time you never had a real cup of coffee until you had one from starbucks. Measure two tablespoons of coffee for every 8oz of water. Dough should begin to form.</p>
