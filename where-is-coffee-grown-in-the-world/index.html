<p><strong>Where Is Coffee Grown In The World</strong>. It is not a new development, as brazil has been the highest global producer of coffee beans for over 150 years. After being grown and harvested in each of these different locations, the coffee beans are then shipped to countries around the world where they are roasted and then distributed to consumers and cafes. These are coffea arabica and coffea robusta (or coffea canephora, depending on which botanist you ask).of the two, it is arabica that is the most appreciated for its deeper flavor and richer qualities, though some regions such as vietnam and parts of africa prefer the bitter, earthy flavors in robusta. It is grown mainly in places that meet requirements for its survival such as higher altitude and tropical climate.</p>
