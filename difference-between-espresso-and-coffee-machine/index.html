<p><strong>Difference Between Espresso And Coffee Machine</strong>. A coffee maker brews for a long time since the particles are not necessarily fine. Generally, espresso needs dark roast, perfect grind, and high pressure to create a shot of concentrated delicious espresso. Espresso is brewed in a shorter period than the drip coffee. The actual difference is the preparation way and coffee beans roasting procedure.</p>

Yes, the coffee that moka pots brew is strong and about as close as you can get to espresso without owning an actual espresso machine, but, by definition, it’s not true espresso. But the key difference between filter and espresso is that, instead of being pushed through with pressure, the water runs through the coffee grounds solely because of gravity. Regular brewed and drip coffee contains more caffeine with roughly 120 milligrams as compared to espresso that generally has about 80 milligrams. Coffee powder is placed inside the machine and very hot water at very high pressure is forced upon this ground coffee so that it extracts all the flavor of the coffee. However, if you get a double or even quadruple espresso shot, you would get an espresso with more caffeine than regular brewed and drip coffee.</p>
