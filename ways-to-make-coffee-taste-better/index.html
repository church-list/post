<p>I finally got around to buying a french press a few weeks ago and i�m still tweaking the right ratio and brewing time to get it just right (though i am drinking it at the right times each day). But the results are worth it. I heard adding a pinch of salt to the grounds helps. Instant coffee has long had a bad reputation for tasting, well, terrible. Or maybe you just had stale beans left in your cupboard. Tell me if this sounds familiar:</p>

<p>What are the 5 ways you can make your coffee taste better? Finding the right grind size may improve the overall taste of your coffee, including the level of bitterness in the coffee. Water is an often overlooked but important part of the coffee making process. A coffee pot is not a cast iron pan and it does not get better as it becomes seasoned. the residue left behind from the brewing process will diminish the taste of your coffee, so it�s important to clean your coffee pot. Ground coffee is much more vulnerable to flavor degeneration than whole beans, and since you won’t likely use up a whole bag of ground coffee at once, it leaves the grounds much more susceptible to oxidation, which happens each time they are exposed to air and results in an unpleasant, bitter taste. Drip coffee tends to taste less bitter if the grinds are medium fine rather than very fine.</p>
