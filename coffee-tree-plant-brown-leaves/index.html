<p>This means you can even have a small coffee arabica plant on your desk. This plant gets a lot of direct sunlight. Posted by 24 days ago. It’s grown a lot but leaves turning brown. I have a dumb cane (i think) plant that is indoors and it has a large brown spot on its leaf with a small yellow halo around the brown spot. This means you can even have a small coffee arabica plant on your desk.</p>
