<p><strong>St Louis Park Coffee Roasters</strong>. The rustic d√©cor and mountain feel give this caf√©, formerly known as kayakÔøΩs coffee, a unique atmosphere. Located deep in south city, sump coffee was a specialty pioneer in this town when it opened in late 2011. This coffee shop is located just north of forest park at the intersection of skinker avenue and forest park parkway. We invite all, from the coffee nerd to the everyday coffee drinker, to enjoy our coffees (no snobbery up in this house).</p>
