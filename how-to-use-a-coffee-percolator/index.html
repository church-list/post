<p>Unlike the marvel drip coffee maker always giving a smooth light flavorful finish, the percolation process results in a stronger, bolder coffee cup. Very big grounds will waste the delicious coffee flavor while too small grounds might dissolve and end back into your coffee hence adding more bitterness. Place the spreader on top of the grounds basket, and then snap the lid onto the percolator. Different brands of camping coffee percolator have different instructions for cooking times. Next, put the percolator�s basket onto the stem and measure in your coffee. Heat until the water boils, then turn the heat to a low temperature and let the coffee perk for several minutes before removing from the heat.</p>
