<p><strong>Cafe Vienna Coffee Drink</strong>. A delicious recipe for cafe vienna mix, with coffee, sugar, milk and cinnamon. This cafe vienna mix is exceptionally smooth and is the perfect way to treat yourself any time of day. Then the cream is twirled and optionally topped off with chocolate sprinklings. Coffee house culture is important in vienna, and there’s probably little that sums up life in the austrian capital better than heading to a coffee shop for cake and a melange (an espresso with steamed milk, topped with foam).</p>

<p>The drink also includes a splash of liquor, preferably kirschwasser—fruit brandy distilled from cherries—which is occasionally replaced with rum of plum brandy. This one is a bit of a misnomer. This instant coffee drink features coffee mixed with decadent flavoring for an international coffee drink taste. Café central is one of the most famous coffee houses in vienna and arguably the best cafe in vienna for the refined interior and exquisite service. The most typical viennese coffee, a wiener melange, is not served with cream. Store in a cool, dry place for up to 2 months.</p>
