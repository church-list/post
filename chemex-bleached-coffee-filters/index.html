<p><strong>Chemex Bleached Coffee Filters</strong>. When buying a coffee filter, avoid all efforts at saving a few cents as that could make all the difference. Chemex filters remove even the finest sediment particles as well as the undesirable oils and fats. If you brew coffee using a chemex or a hario v60, 02, and 03 drippers, i highly recommend using the able brewing reusable kone coffee filter. I have tried the unbleached and i have tried other brands.</p>

<p>White chemex filters are bleached through an oxidizing cleansing bath followed by a series of hot water baths. We recommend the bleached ones, read here why! My unbleached vs bleached filter experiment so, as most of you know it�s believed that the unbleached filters give a papery taste to your coffee versus the bleached filters. Many coffee drinkers avoid bleached coffee filters because they know that manufacturers use either chlorine or oxygen to bleach the paper. However, in case you are looking for bigger retailers, you can purchase them from, wal mart, cost plus world market, bed, bath and beyond.

Bleached and unbleached coffee filters generally have minimal effect on how your coffee will taste. If you brew coffee using a chemex or a hario v60, 02, and 03 drippers, i highly recommend using the able brewing reusable kone coffee filter. The chemex cup of coffee had a thinner texture, brought out the floral notes, and a bit of dryness in mouthfeel.
