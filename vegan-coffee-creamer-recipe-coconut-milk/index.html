<p><strong>Vegan Coffee Creamer Recipe Coconut Milk</strong>. And, it’s a great way to give up processed sugar and dairy from your morning coffee. Aside from having an extra distinct flavor and making it creamy, this vegan creamer also adds a boost of nutrition to your cup of coffee. I think adding a coffee syrup, like torani would add more flavor. A good friend once said to me, “drinking tea is like getting a friendly handshake, but drinking coffee is like getting a warm hug.” it’s so so true.</p>

<p>This coffee creamer is keto friendly, paleo, dairy free, vegan, all natural, has only 4 ingredients, and can be made in 5 minutes. I look forward to the warm embrace of a good cup ‘o joe every morning with my breakfast.i do like a touch of sweetness and creaminess in my coffee though (sorry to all you black coffee purists)! It isn’t overly coconut tasting, and doesn’t separate in the fridge. Make sure to shake the creamer well before using. Reviewers claim the unsweetened version is the best tasting of all the varieties. A great quality coconut milk can make coffee taste pretty awesome, so i whipped up some homemade vanilla coffee creamer made with just a few ingredients and canned coconut cream.</p>
