<p>I personally like the starbucks via packets which have that rich, deep multilayered smell and taste of a fresh dark roast gourmet coffee. For a fraction of the cost of those $$$ starbucks packets. I made a cup for my wife who also enjoyed it. Totally portable fairtrade coffee in an instant; 25 single coffee packets to go! Because mount hagen is so fussy about choosing beans for their organic instant coffee, it might be difficult to tell the difference between mount hagen instant and freshly brewed.</p>
