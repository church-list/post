<p>4.2 out of 5 stars 26. Visit your local kitchenaid service center for replacement. Choose from contactless same day delivery, drive up and more. Purchased as a replacement for the carafe that came with our kitchenaid 14 cup coffee maker (kcm222cu), which has a flat pouring spout. All this and looks fantastic, plus easy to clean. This resulted in having a very unhappy husband first thing in the morning, as the coffee was consistently spilled on the counter and floor, regardless of how slow you poured your coffee.</p>

<p>However, i went to wash the carafe in the sink and set it down on the disk rack on bottom of sink and it cracked. It happened the first time with my first kitchen coffee pot also but i had that coffee maker for about seven years, so it was time to get a new coffee pot anyway. Brew one pot of fresh, cool water and discard before brewing the first pot of coffee (first time use only). Philomena ramone february 1, 2018. However, i went to wash the carafe in the sink and set it down on the disk rack on bottom of sink and it cracked. 4.5 out of 5 stars with 52 reviews.</p>
