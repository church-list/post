Since water is scarce in this arid land, coffee beans grown here tend to be smaller, and more irregular in size and shape. It is not a new development, as brazil has been the highest global producer of coffee beans for over 150 years. It is grown in more than 50 countries world wide with about 30 of those countries producing more than 5,000,000 tons of coffee each year. Making a niche for itself in the organic coffee market grown in the apurimac river and elsewhere, peru also produces mild, flavorful, and aromatic coffee in the chanchamayo and urubamba valleys. Coffee is grown in the western parts of the country throughout the three mountain ranges running parallel to the pacific coast.</p>
