<p>When browsing the web for animal poop coffee beans, luwak coffee is probably the first hit. To make things confusing, each country has given civet coffee its own name: After about 24 hours the coffee beans are defecated by the civet cat. This is why there are now many civet farms which operate in southeast asia and keep thousands of animals which live in cages and are force fed.

The civet’s digestion process neutralizes and removes the coffee beans’ acidity, and these acidic compounds are essential for a coffee’s flavor and sweetness.</p>
