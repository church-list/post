<p>For our 8 oz mason jar, we measured 1/3 cup of grounds. Add enough cold water to fill the jar halfway. The mason jar does not come with coffee. Admit it, you probably bought that mason jar because it looks good on the shelf and not for its intended purpose: The cold brew you don’t drink (yeah right!) can just be left in the jar and refrigerated for a few days. Using a funnel (or just being very careful) pour the freshly ground coffee into the filter.</p>

<p>How to make cold brew in a mason jar. You put coffee grounds in the jar, fill it with water, put a lid on. For the best results, they should have a wide mouth and hold at least a quart of coffee. Just add the cold water to the mason jar, top with the ground coffee, stir it all together, and let it sit at room temperature for 12 hours. If you want to make a large batch of cold brew, just put more coffee beans into your mason jar. We know that�s a long time to wait for a cup of coffee, but it is worth every minute.</p>
