<p>Iced coffee is simply brewed coffee with ice. It’s not only more bitter and more acidic but certainly cheaper. The main difference between cold brew and iced coffee is in their brewing methods. The difference between cold brew and iced coffee comes down to how it is made and the flavor that comes out of that process. On the other hand, iced coffee is made using room temperature or hot water. The methods of preparation also differ along with the taste.</p>

<p>During hot days, i drink cold coffee. The ‘cold’ in cold brew doesn’t come from the temperature of the coffee, but rather the process of making it. Cold brew, rather confusingly, refers to the brewing process, which uses cold to room temperature water over a long period of time to a make concentrated brew that’s low on acidity but big on body and caffeine. I realize it can be confusing; The key difference between cold brew and iced coffee is that the cold brew is brewed in cold water without heating whereas the iced coffee is brewed as normal coffee, which is then cooled down. Iced coffee is made through hot water brewing whereas cold brew requires a longer process of brewing through cold or room temperature water.</p>
