<p>Many gardeners like to use used coffee grounds as a mulch for their plants. While coffee grounds can lower the ph in the soil and attract worms, which is in turn good for roses, too much can create a nitrogen burn which is very bad for your roses. The natural fungus colonies in decomposing coffee grounds help fight off the types of fungus that cause harm in your garden. The caffeine in the grounds can also suppress the growth of other plants’ roots, which can become a problem over time or if too much is added. (using a ph test or ph meter can help you to get more insight into the soil condition you are working with and your results). Roots of the rose plants can easily draw upon this stored moisture when needed.</p>
