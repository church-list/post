<p><strong>How To Make Coffee Foam In Blender</strong>. But you can make it without blender as well which takes more time. You really don’t even need a frothing wand to make a latte at home. It’s a delicious coffee made by whipping instant coffee together with sugar and a bit of water with a spoon to make a thick foam (think shaving cream). If you don’t have any blender you can use a spoon as well.</p>

<p>Use a coffee filter to filter coffee from the soaked coffee. I purchased a glass blender (because the hot coffee was damaging my plastic ninja blender.) It serves multiple purposes (coffee/tea maker, milk frother, etc.), and the foam it creates is a bit better for latte art. Coffee can do a lot for you, so you can start drinking coffee. You can adjust the amount ingredients as per servings you are planning to make. The spout is also narrower, which makes pouring art easier.</p>
