<p>One of these things is japanese canned coffee. We ended up getting some japanese canned coffee show up in australian night owls (711) in around 2010 where you�d crack it and a chemical reaction in the base would heat the coffee up. The japanese word for the pollock roe is called tarako. The idea for coffee in a can was born. Hot and cold canned coffee is readily available in vending machines like other beverages for about 120 jpy per can. It’s not that it’s rude, it’s just that it’s odd.</p>
<h3 id="at-its-best-japanese-coffee-exhibits-the-extraordinary-care-taken-at-each-stage-of-the-process">At its best, japanese coffee exhibits the extraordinary care taken at each stage of the process:</h3>
<p>From bean selection to the level of roast and grind, and finally the technique and skill of the maker. The idea for coffee in a can was born. Our line of handy beverages includes ucc milk coffee, launched in 1969 as the world�s first canned coffee beverage, ucc black unsweetened, a pioneering black coffee drink, ucc shokunin no coffee, a plastic bottled drink made with authentic ground coffee, and more. Curiously, no one drinks or eats while walking in japan. But considering how fucking good australian prepackaged ice coffee already is (dare, ice break and hundreds of others) it died out pretty quick. It’s not that it’s rude, it’s just that it’s odd.</p>
