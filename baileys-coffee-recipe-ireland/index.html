<p>A fantastic benefit to making this baileys irish cream recipe at home is that it is often cheaper to make it than to buy an actual bottle of baileys irish cream. I can’t imagine never having tasted bailey’s irish cream before, but if you’ve never had it, get ready to thank me! Pour baileys into a rocks glass. Baileys has a history to rival that of the original irish coffee. This was definitely a new experience for me, an experience that i loved though. More importantly, it�s unmistakably irish, making this recipe something approaching gospel.</p>
