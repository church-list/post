<p>The best thing about this creamer is that it adds its unique flavor without overpowering the taste of your coffee. The original soy creamer has 30 calories per tablespoon and contains soy milk, cane sugar, and palm oil for a creamier sip. Nut pods is the most comparable to half and half in the whole list of creamers! That’s how we know how to get a silky smooth and creamy cup—without any dairy—with every single pour of silk original creamer. The company has since developed an almond milk variety, but the original cannot be beat. All of califia farms coffee creamers are vegan!</p>
