<p><strong>Browning Gun Barrel With Coffee Grounds</strong>. Grouse hunters need good legs and light shotguns, the 59 solved half of it. The nickname was derived from its being crank operated with a hopper feed located on top so that it closely resembled the contemporary kitchen coffee grinder. The barrel is left exposed in the air for about 24 hours, after which a thin layer of reddish brown rust is formed on the surface. It also has the us formula for browning gun barrels if anyone is interested.</p>

<p>The process was understood and used by most. I can�t remember the name of what they called the shot barrel steel. I don�t know how the poor gal was able to perform as long as she had.
