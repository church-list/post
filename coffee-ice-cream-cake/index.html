<p><strong>Coffee Ice Cream Cake</strong>. My husband said this was the best ice cream cake he has ever had! I didn�t add the mini marshmallows decorated the marshmallow creme instead. As you place cake in the freezer, take out ice cream to soften on the counter. My husband’s favorite cake is a dairy queen ice cream cake, and he has passed that love onto our daughter.</p>

<p>Sprinkle 2 tablespoons ground espresso evenly over surface of cake. Place pan in freezer for about 10 minutes. We especially love the fudge sauce recipe. While cake is freezing, make hardening chocolate. Since my birthday was during the summer, ice cream cake was a requirement. Its all about fun, entertainment, laughter, and happiness.</p>

<p>Crunchy layers of meringue are the perfect compliment to smooth coffee ice cream in this adult ice cream cake. Mix softened ice cream and cool whip together. Then prepare the coffee ice cream. Since my birthday was during the summer, ice cream cake was a requirement. Then, it’s just a few hours in the freezer and you have the dreamiest, creamiest coffee ice cream with big chunks of chocolate toffee bar on a chocolate cookie crust. Meanwhile, mix remaining cookies with ice cream mixture and place in fridge.</p>
