<p><strong>Coffee Plantation Hawaii Oahu</strong>. Bordered by the steep, dramatic waianae and ko’olau mountains and tempered by the rolling pacific surf, the coffee is as lush as its island surroundings. See the oahu you want to see with a private tour that can be. Both thrive under the warm sun and abundant rains of our tropical climate. I don�t think they have coffee trees though.</p>

<p>I loved it, but i am a huge history nerd. This original hawaiian coffee plantation was established over 150 years ago, though the coffee industry soon gave way to the sugar industry, which was king for quite some time. We are a small farm situated on the famous north shore of oahu hawaii. The plantation fields are near the site of hawaii’s first commercial coffee plantation, established more than 150 years ago. Hello, i leave for oahu in 2 days and have not found information on cofee farms/plantations on oahu. There are hundreds of coffee farms in kona, from the small art town of holualoa to kealakekua, and many offer tours.</p>
