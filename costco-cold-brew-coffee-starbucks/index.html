<p>It�s my go to for cold brew when i�m making a big batch for guests or an event in the summer. Roasted by starbucks should have been a red flag. According to moneywise﻿, a ton of kirkland products are actually manufactured by big brands and then sold under the kirkland name, including coffee, which is roasted by starbucks. I asked about it a few times and yesterday they told me it had been “discontinued” though they weren’t sure if that meant reformulated, repackaged, or actually discontinued. But be careful with some of starbucks cold brew bottle varieties. Cold brews are now one trendy option for many folks who prefer a less bitter, more flavorful coffee than the hot stuff.</p>
