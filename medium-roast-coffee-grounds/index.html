<p><strong>Medium Roast Coffee Grounds</strong>. Roasting to this level also preserves many of the unique flavors of the coffee’s origin, but it also begins to reach into the deep caramel sweetness of a longer roast. The biggest deciding factor when shopping for coffee grounds is the roast. “the best part of wakin’ up is folgers in your cup!” at least, that’s what folgers would like you to believe in their tv ads. Made of central and south american from 100% premium arabica coffee beans, this has to be one of the truest “medium roasts” i’ve come across yet.</p>

<p>Dunkin’ donuts ground coffee, original blend medium roast tastes like you just ordered dunkin’s coffee from the shop…only at home &amp; much more affordable!!! Medium roasts tend to have fuller bodies, as the sugars are developed but not broken down. Before coffee gets ground and put in a bag, it starts off its life as a fruit, which looks a lot like a cherry. Medium roasted coffee is medium brown in color, whereas a light roasted coffee is a light brown. Coffee trees thrive on the cool slopes of the hualalai and mauna loa mountains in rich volcanic soil and afternoon cloud cover. As can be guessed, dark roasted coffee grounds are much darker in color.</p>

That’s primarily because the glucose has been heated up and activated, but it also hasn’t burned away yet. Roasting to this level also preserves many of the unique flavors of the coffee’s origin, but it also begins to reach into the deep caramel sweetness of a longer roast. Just open the bag and brew. Light, medium, or dark roast. With that in mind, let’s start with the medium roast:</p>
