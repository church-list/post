<p><strong>Coffee Grounds For Plants Bugs</strong>. In order to use coffee grounds as a mosquito repellent/insecticide, pour fine, used coffee grounds into any small, still bodies of water near your house, such as in small ponds of puddles in or around your backyard. Some gardeners suggest creating a compost tea out of coffee grounds compost to water the soil of the plants to keep bugs away. Unwashed coffee grounds will lower the ph level of your garden (raise the acidity), which is great for plants that like acidic soil, but hurts plants that prefer less acidic soil. Once they’ve moved in close by they’ll enter your home in search of food and of course create unsightly ant hills in your garden, lawn, or in cracks in your patio.</p>
