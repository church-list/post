<p>From cheesy breads to green salads. Panera introduced a beverage subscription service earlier this year, charging $8.99 a month for unlimited drip hot coffee, hot tea, and iced coffee drinks. Actually, it is not a fully fast food restaurant. While i found myself opting for panera bread’s iced coffee over the hot coffee choices, it was mainly because most panera bread does not offer free flavor shots with this subscription and, if you know me, you know i no longer drink black coffee.
