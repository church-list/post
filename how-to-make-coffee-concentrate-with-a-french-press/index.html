<p>Gently press down on french press plunger to separate grounds from liquid. Since i prefer strong coffee, i make my iced coffee using a 1:1 ratio of concentrate to water. Pour out the preheat water and pour in your fresh ground coffee. Then, set up a pour over coffee maker and pour the cold brew concentrate through the paper. Give the water a stir, making sure that all coffee grounds are saturated. The low acid prep makes the coffee naturally sweet.</p>

<p>Keep chilled in the fridge until ready to use. Of course, you don�t have to use the concentrate to serve a crowd. My recipe uses a french press or a mason jar and a fine mesh strainer or nut milk bag. Then, set up a pour over coffee maker and pour the cold brew concentrate through the paper. The recipe for this coffee concentrate uses a 1:2 ratio of beans to water. It�s important to remember, however, when using a french press that the metal filter may not catch all the grounds.</p>
