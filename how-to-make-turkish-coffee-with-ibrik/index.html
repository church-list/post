<p>It is prepared in an ibrik, a small pot that holds either one or two servings. Wait until the coffee rises (this should take 2.5 to 3.5 minutes) Traditionally turkish coffee is made with the little ibrik resting in a wide shallow pot full of sand. Combine the coffee, water, and desired amount of sugar in the cezve and stir vigorously to combine all the ingredients. What you mean is a cezve. The fire under the pot heats the sand to a hot, even temperature.</p>

<p>How to make turkish coffee with an ibrik firstly, we’ll outline how you can use the turkish brewing method with an ibrik. A good pot of turkish coffee will have a lot of foam. All of our turkish coffee makers are made with copper and are 100% lead free. Use a teaspoon to scoop up and transfer some of the foam into each turkish coffee cup. Just directly add the measured amount of turkish coffee grounds. However, if you’re not concerned with tradition, you can enjoy turkish coffee from any mug.</p>
