<p>So, when you purchase our varieties of decaffeinated coffee, you won’t just be supporting an australian company but also farmers and workers all over the world!. In addition to using high quality colombian supremo, cafe don pablo is decaffeinated using an all natural swiss water method. Drinking two or more cups of decaf coffee per day has also been linked with up to a 48% lower risk. The most popular product from one of australia’s favourite instant coffee brands, the moccona classic medium roast perfectly balances full bodied flavour with easy drinking smoothness. This process helps remove caffeine while preserving the coffee beans� aromatic oils. The very process of removing caffeine from coffee can sometimes strip the beans of the chemicals that give coffee its bold and complex flavors, significantly increasing the chances of a flat and bland end product.</p>
