<p>Add the cardamom pods and maple syrup into the hot coffee, mix and leave the coffee to cool down completely and let the cardamom flavour infuse into the coffee. Combine half and half and syrup in a sauce pan over medium heat, stirring constantly until thoroughly heated (do not boil!). It is a sweet dessert coffee. Add the milk, vanilla and ice cubes to a tall glass, then spoon in the whipped up coffee and maple. Stir and sweeten to taste with a touch more maple. Heat up the milk for 30 seconds in a microwave (or until warm), then put it in a jar, close the lid and give it a good shake to get it nice and foamy.</p>
