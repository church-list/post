<p>Coffee grounds contain several key minerals for plant growth — nitrogen, calcium, potassium, iron, phosphorus, magnesium and chromium. Coffee grounds improve soil tilth or structure. If you want to lower your soil�s ph, elemental sulfur is a good option. Washed coffee grounds have a ph level of 6.5, which is almost neutral. If you’re using caffeinated grounds (either fresh or spent), they will have a high caffeine content, which may be a potential source of trouble. According to science daily, brewed coffee grounds typically possess a ph level that measures between 6.5 and 6.8, which fits into the preferred soil ph levels for most plants.</p>

You can scratch it into the top couple inches of soil, or just sprinkle the grounds on top and leave it alone. Coffee grounds are close to ph neutral (between 6.5 to 6.8 ph). But this is only true for unwashed coffee grounds. What is the ph of coffee grounds?</p>
