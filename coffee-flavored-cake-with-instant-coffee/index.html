<p>I find that in most recipes, it�s too much liquid for the amount of coffee flavor i want. Sprinkle with remaining coffee mixture. If you want more coffee flavor, you can try adding another 1/4 cup of strong coffee to bring the total to 3/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup. Gradually add the icing sugar (you add it gradually to stop it flying everywhere) and beat until fully combined. Square baking pan coated with cooking spray; It adds a lot less liquid and as much punchy flavor as you want.</p>
