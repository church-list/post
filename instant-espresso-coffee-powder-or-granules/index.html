<p><strong>Instant Espresso Coffee Powder Or Granules</strong>. You will need to dissolve instant coffee granules first if you plan to add it to something like cookie dough since it won’t mix right in the way espresso powder does. I haven�t tried espresso powder but i have tried via and it is decent tasting.

Espresso powder is made from darkly roasted coffee beans that have been ground, brewed, dried, and then ground to a very fine powder.</p>
