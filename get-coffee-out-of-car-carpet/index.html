<p>It is pretty easy to get rid of a fresh coffee stain, but you may need to repeat the process a couple of times. A while ago i spilled about 2 large cups of tim horton coffee into my car�s carpet. Great, but is there any link between my carpet types and coffee stains? Gently blot the coffee spill to absorb as much of the moisture from the car seat fabric as you can. A pet carpet cleaner is a good solution because it can break down the proteins in the stain. Spilling it on your carpet is sure to give you a boost of adrenaline, but don’t worry, there are several methods for removing coffee stains from carpet.</p>

Club soda is a popular cleaning ingredient in a car carpet stain remover, as well. Just like you would with a wet coffee stain, use a clean cloth to blot the wet area to pull up any loosened coffee.</p>
