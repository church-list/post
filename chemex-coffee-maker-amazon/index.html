<p>It can make me experience like a coffee connoisseur. Blue horse caddy for chemex coffee maker with matching brown mat 4.9 out of 5 stars 667. To keep a chemex warm on an electric stovetop with exposed coils, you should use a steel wire grid (sold by chemex) to prevent fracturing of the chemex. Made from borosilicate glass and fastened with a wood collar and tie, the chemex coffeemaker brews without imparting any flavors of its own.
