<p>Well, to be honest, it�s more like my very loud and proud pleasure but i�m sure you get my thought process. Its color and taste have allowed for the moniker “chicory root coffee,” although there is no coffee in it. Try a 1:4 or 1:5 ratio of chicory to coffee. We also enjoy a cup after dinner with a little knibble on some chocolate. I did not find the 2:1 ratios to be too overwhelming and, on the flip side, i could distinctly taste (and smell) the chicory at a 10:1 ratio. Another trick is to add a pinch of salt before the brew cycle, which will take away some of the bitter edge.</p>

<p>You may want to stretch your coffee supply so that it lasts a bit longer. Chicory coffee is the result of the roasting and grounding of the root of the cultivated plant species, chicorium intybus, subspecies sativum. These are the roasted roots of the plants. Today, chicory remains popular in new orleans, and new orleans coffee typically refers to chicory coffee. We also enjoy a cup after dinner with a little knibble on some chocolate. Perfect on its own or blended with your favorite roast.</p>
