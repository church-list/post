<p><strong>Midtown Detroit Coffee Shops</strong>. The truth is, we love detroit and hate leaving it. As of november 2020 our flagship corktown location is currently in hibernation for the season. As a small business, we have invested heavily in the last few years in building our business and community there. These coffee shops are popular with detroit locals for their nice outdoor spaces.</p>
