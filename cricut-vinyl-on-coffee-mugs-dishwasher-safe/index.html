<p>Jeezum crow, it’s been ten years!. I’m a huge fan of coffee mugs with sayings on them. These cricut infusible ink mugs are the perfect valentine or anniversary gift. Cricut has not come out with their own brand, but there are many options online. I found that if you are going to wash your mugs in the dishwasher, the adhesive permanent vinyl is best hands down. I am delighted to report that our cricut community members have been creating many fun designs that i look forward to crafting to support my cocoa obsession.</p>

<p>It has been put in the dishwasher almost daily and still has most of the vinyl on it. Carefully remove the backing from the vinyl, and position the vinyl on the mug. This will open up the “canvas” area in designspace. Jeezum crow, it’s been ten years!. As the temps warm up we all seem to migrate outside which means more places to craft up some projects! Dishwasher safe forever and no mug press required!</p>
