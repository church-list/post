<p><strong>Making A Coffee Table Out Of Wood</strong>. Remove the door, if it’s still mounted to a frame, and refinish to enhance the natural wood or give it a fresh coat of paint.then attach it to a table framework.

I drilled pocket holes in the top of the four legs of the base and used pocket hole screws to attach the top. My wife had been expressing some interest in a new coffee table for our living room for her birthday so i figured the best way to ensure a quality coffee table was to make it myself.</p>
