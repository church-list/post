<p>This baileys fudge from lisa at wine and glue is a classic version with a creamy baileys twist. Melt the butter in a large frying pan over a medium heat. However, some websites that offer a homemade version of baileys have included eggs as an ingredient. This recipe will serve 2 and contains no more than 0.6 fluid ounces of alcohol per serving.
