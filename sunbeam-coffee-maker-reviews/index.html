<p>Also, this machine has been turning on by itself. For me the time to clean the machine properly was a bigger drawback than brew time by far. If you are looking for a simple coffeemaker without any frills, then sunbeam coffee maker is definitely a good choice. The sunbeam barista max is a great coffee machine, makes really nice coffee, and is easy to use. Put the brewing on hold with delay brew to set start time up to 24 hours in advance while the fresh brew ™ timer tracks just how long your coffee has been ready. But what the heck, it works, and it makes coffee every bit as good as a $200.</p>

<p>The sunbeam vacpots has been rated 8.98 overall by our member reviewers: We have upgraded from the sunbeam cafe espresso ii ($150 at big w), and while this was a good entry level coffee machine and we were very happy with it, the sunbeam barista max is a wonderful upgrade with. We only make coffee in the morning and shut it off after the coffee has been consumed. It’s also been tested by choice and sunbeam is the 6th most popular coffee machine brand, according to canstar blue. Look up the sunbeam barista max on the net or in a nearby appliance store. In addition to programming your brew time, this model also comes with an automatic shut off after 2 hours of keeping your coffee warm.</p>
