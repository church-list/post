<p>There is a major difference and it depends on how they are brewed, the types of beans that are used, and much more. One isn�t better than the other, but they�re made differently and definitely have distinct tastes. Cold brew coffee is generally a smoother and stronger taste that can be enjoyed just with ice, whereas iced coffee gets diluted down and is more enjoyable for some to drink. Cold brew is made without any heat, which makes the drink smoother since it has lower acidity, thus giving it a natural sweetness that cannot be found in iced coffee. Both methods use hot water to extract yumminess from the coffee, so you experience the full range of flavors that you would if you were drinking it hot. Although cold brew is cold coffee, it’s certainly not iced coffee.</p>

From brewing methods to nutritional information, here is the difference between iced coffee and cold brew. While cold brew is cold coffee, it�s definitely not iced coffee.
