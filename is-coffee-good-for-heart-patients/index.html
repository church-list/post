<p><strong>Is Coffee Good For Heart Patients</strong>. In fact, they suggest that regular coffee use actually protects patients from atrial fibrillation. Granted, this risk is relatively small with coffee—but it’s important for patients with conditions like heart disease to be aware of it, since small deficiencies in nutrients like magnesium can have a big impact on heart function. In one study, patients who were coffee drinkers at the time of their heart attack fared better than patients who had heart attacks who did not drink coffee. The total caffeine given equaled that found in four cups of coffee, and the capsules were consumed in the morning and at lunchtime.</p>

<p>By amy norton healthday reporter In the past, coffee was generally regarded as being detrimental to heart health. In 2006, adam founded heartvalvesurgery.com to educate and empower patients. Coffee was once considered unhealthy, but new studies have shown coffee to have powerful health benefits. There are not a lot of studies looking at whether drinking coffee after a heart attack is good or bad. Coffee is an excellent source of antioxidants, which may help protect cells from damage.</p>

<p>Caffeine is a stimulant and causes increased or irregular heart rate in patients with chf. Caffeine constricts blood vessels and forces the heart to contract with a stronger rapid force leading to a rapid and irregular heartbeat. The majority of studies on coffee and coronary heart disease (chd) found no association between coffee consumption and coronary heart disease. Some studies observed statistically significant inverse associations, particularly for women10,11. Caffeine concerns aside, coffee does have some pretty significant health benefits. This review cannot prove that coffee is good for the heart and can only show a possible association between coffee drinking and risk of heart failure.</p>
