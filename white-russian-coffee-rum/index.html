<p>The base spirit in kahlua is actually rum, sweetened and flavored to make it into a liqueur. When koloa rum company told me about their amazing kaua’i coffee rum last year i couldn’t wait to try it. Originally made in brussels, belgium, the drink was created in honor of the u.s. Simply stir together the coffee liqueur, vodka, and ice in a short rocks glass. This time it is my take on the white russian, with a hawaiian white russian. To make this drink, all you need is vodka, coffee liqueur (i prefer kahlua), eggnog (of course!), and nutmeg to sprinkle on top.</p>

There are also many different options available, including bottles that have been around for decades and newer craft distillery expressions. Try swapping out the coffee liqueur with crème de cacao or amaretto.</p>
