<p><strong>Kahlua Baileys Coffee Drinks</strong>. This playful recipe from the drink blog takes the basic structure of a white russian but uses mead instead of vodka, much more fitting for a norwegian thunder god. The mudslide is a frozen cocktail combination of vodka, kahlua and baileys, blended until smooth. This is because it has a higher alcohol content. To make one, layer ½ ounce each of kahlua, baileys, and triple sec.</p>
