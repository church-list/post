<p><strong>Owning A Coffee Shop Uk</strong>. Despite 2020 being an absolute dumpster fire, itâ€™s actually still a great time to enter the coffee business. A coffee shop, sandwich bar or coffee kiosk should all be researched properly before opening. A minimum of $80,000 to start a food and beverage business seems like a lot of money, and you might not be comfortable applying for loans of this size (or a larger amount), and thatâ€™s okay. You can start a mobile coffee / tea business at a relatively small price.</p>
