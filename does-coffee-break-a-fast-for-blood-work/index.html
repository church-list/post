<p><strong>Does Coffee Break A Fast For Blood Work</strong>. Fasting for metabolic health/weight loss: Drinking coffee before blood tests is not recommended, but drinking a good amount of water is advised as this helps make veins more visible, therefore making the blood extraction easier. Caffeine can temporarily raise blood sugar levels resulting to an inaccurate fasting blood sugar (fbs) result. I don’t recommend counting calories.</p>

<p>Schedule your test as early in the day as possible. Your doctor may request a blood specimen that requires previous fasting for accurate analysis. The three most common reasons people fast are for weight loss/metabolic health, gut rest, or longevity. So absolutely, milk/cream will break the fast. Fasting tests restrict everything but water. Drinking coffee before blood tests is not recommended, but drinking a good amount of water is advised as this helps make veins more visible, therefore making the blood extraction easier.</p>

<p>Does heavy cream break a fast? Does not break a fast; Plain, black coffee will not. Fasting tests restrict everything but water. Now, if you add cream or sugar, then you’ve blown your fast because those things contain calories. But will drinking a cup of black coffee skew the results and provide an inaccurate reading?</p>
