<p><strong>Good Coffee For Beginners</strong>. For our search through the sea of delicious coffees available for purchase online, we stuck to. Many beginners find this intimidating, but i’ve got good news for you: This is because the coffee suddenly expands (a little) and releases some co2, which interacts with the natural fats in the coffee, and produces that foam.

There is a tendency to fetishise coffee these days, be it its provenance (“single origin” might be the most overused term in this industry) or its production (you know what i mean if you’ve had a barista asked you if you like your filter coffee brewed with a v60, aeropress, siphon, flannel or the sheer force of his muscular palms pressing together). The basic idea with cashew coffee is to blend up a serving of cashews with a cup of brewed coffee.</p>
