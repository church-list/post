<p>Below we dive into what makes shade grown coffee different from your regular coffee beans and why it’s becoming more popular. In fact, until only a few decades ago, shade grown coffee represented the bulk of coffee beans sold on the world coffee market. We work only with arabica beans of specialty quality with scaa rating above 84, 90% of these beans are arabica tipica and the rest are arabica bourbon, arabica caturra and arabica catuai. The cooling effect of shade produces higher quality, denser beans that can be sold for a higher price to specialty coffee roasters. All our green coffee is natural shade grown high altitude above 1100m and most of our coffee comes from strict high grown (shg) areas above 1400m. From the mountains of nayarit, mexico to your cup, is where we unleash the secrets that have been passed down to create the best coffee that you have ever tasted.</p>
