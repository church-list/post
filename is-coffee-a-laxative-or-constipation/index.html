<p><strong>Is Coffee A Laxative Or Constipation</strong>. It may be argued that coffee can�t be called a laxative because it�s a diuretic. Stimulation of the bowels should cause increased bowel movements. Constipation is a very common complaint, and a person’s lifestyle and diet often play a role. Constipation medically is defined as less than three bowel movements per week.</p>

<p>It may be argued that coffee can�t be called a laxative because it�s a diuretic. Some people use coffee deliberately as a laxative and it can indeed stimulate the process of peristalsis that sends you to the bathroom. One of the most recommended natural remedies for constipation is prune juice. Not all studies have demonstrated that coffee has a laxative effect. Take senna, an herbal laxative. It contains certain nutrients and compounds that make it an effective laxative aid.</p>

<p>Stimulation of the bowels should cause increased bowel movements. That means coffee should cause diarrhoea rather than constipation. Milk or cream may promote bowel movements freshly brewed coffee is. In fact, the laxative effect of coffee is so strong it has been observed in studies to happen only 4 minutes after drinking it. Most people do not use coffee as a laxative in cases of severe constipation, but when digestive problems are minor, coffee can be very effective. However if avoiding it solves the problem.</p>
