<p><strong>Restoration Hardware Coffee Table Diy</strong>. Its very sturdy and fun to make too. A far cry from rh’s $1700 price tag! From ‘store front life’, this diy iron and rope mirror retails for more than $600 at rh… kristen pulled of this amazing hack for $30… and like all the other projects here, there is no way you can tell it isn’t the real. I knew i wanted this table to be big and beefy, so i was immediately drawn to using 4×4’s for the base.</p>
