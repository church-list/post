<p>One suggestion is to add approximately a third leaves, third grass clippings and a third coffee grounds to your compost pile. It’s almost as if they “swarm” to the grounds. Many wormeries use stacking trays for the worms to work up through. Nearly as popular as using coffee to acidify your soil, is the use of coffee grounds to compost. Coffee filters are also fine. Save coffee grounds separately, or throw them in your compost collection container.</p>

<p>Many leave the grounds in the filter and throw the whole shebang into their compost bucket or pile. It’s also important to make sure that the grounds are always moist, not dry before adding to the bin. Once emptied, and the worms separated, the wormery can be filled with a new layer of bedding, the worms returned. People doing vermicomposting regularly, recommend the addition of coffee grounds to the worm bin, provided you do not add too much. Used coffee filters can be composted as well. Sometimes the worms form a ball as big as a grapefruit in the compost bin in the coffee layer.</p>
