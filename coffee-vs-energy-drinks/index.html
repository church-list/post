<p><strong>Coffee Vs Energy Drinks</strong>. In short this means that coffee will elevate your heart rate to a much greater degree than an energy drink, and this can make it far less appropriate for doing sports as it can place a strain on the heart (exercise itself already increases the heart rate).
