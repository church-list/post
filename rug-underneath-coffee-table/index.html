A good rule to follow is that the chairs should be on the rug, even when they�re pulled out from the table. The vast majority of living rooms, dining rooms and master bedrooms will require an 8’x10′ rug. If you want to be confident that you�re choosing the right area rug size for your dining room table, simply add at least 60 inches to the length and the width of your table to get your ideal rug size. As you sit and enjoy your food, you can gently rake your toes through the pile and not miss out on any of the elegance and opulence that an expensive carpet offers. Once attached your rug will never wrinkle or move around again.</p>

<p>To choose an area rug to go directly under the coffee table, of course you need to make sure all four legs of your coffee table rest on the rug. For a layout like this, it’s best to coordinate the rug color to the flooring to make the space look bigger.
