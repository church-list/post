<p><strong>Espresso Or Coffee Caffeine</strong>. When compared with a regular shot of coffee, a 12 oz shot is about 120mg of caffeine whereas in a 2oz shot of espresso you can only get 80mg of caffeine. There is a good deal of misinformation in regards to caffeine from black espresso and coffee. That’s right, it’s quick to make and quick to consume, just like the caffeine buzz it. Espresso differs from coffee in the way it is brewed—by forcing hot water through ground espresso beans.</p>

<p>It is a brewing method that extracts many of the best aromatic mixtures that can be found in roasted brew. Caffeine content in drip coffee (8oz) vs espresso (1oz)* However, if you get a double or even quadruple espresso shot, you would get an espresso with more caffeine than regular brewed and drip coffee. It may be more concentrated, but espresso is actually lower in caffeine than brewed coffee. One 2 oz double espresso has about 80 milligrams of caffeine while a 12 oz brewed coffee has 120 milligrams. But then, the bitter taste doesn’t come from the caffeine but due to the bitter compounds produced because of the maillard reaction.</p>
<h3 id="in-general-the-more-caffeine-in-your-coffee-the-more-likely-you-are-to-have-side-effects-from-the-caffeine">In general, the more caffeine in your coffee, the more likely you are to have side effects from the caffeine.</h3>
<p>Regular brewed and drip coffee contains more caffeine with roughly 120 milligrams as compared to espresso that generally has about 80 milligrams. The actual caffeine content of any coffee drink varies by size, bean origin, roast method and other factors, but a typical 28 grams (1 ounce) serving. So technically speaking, yes caffeine levels are higher in an espresso shot as compared to regular coffee. Most people happily upsize their coffee, easily doubling or even tripling the amount of caffeine that they consume. It may be more concentrated, but espresso is actually lower in caffeine than brewed coffee. On the other hand, one cup of drip coffee has closer to 150 mg of caffeine.</p>
