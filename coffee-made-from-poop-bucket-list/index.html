<p><strong>Coffee Made From Poop Bucket List</strong>. This extremely rare and exceptionally spendy brew is—we shit you not—made from the partially digested coffee cherries eaten and defecated by a cat (the asian palm civet, to be exact). Though i have known couples that dated—i use the term lightly—who haven’t shared a common language, i am. It has a hint of chocolate, that lingers on the tongue with a long, clean aftertaste. This coffee is called elephant dung coffee or black ivory coffee.</p>

<p>I do not plan to do any of the above ever in my life. The kopi luwak rose to popularity after oprah mentioned it in her show. Having one bucket toilet is better than none, but it is going to be very messy to use. “you’re shitting me!” says nicholson, to which freeman replies amid a huge belly laugh, “no, the cats beat me to it!” Jack nicholson also consumes it in his movie ‘bucket list’ and it has since made it several people’s bucket list. Due to the rarity and high price of kopi luwak, there are no refunds or exchanges available on this coffee, unlike other volcanica coffees.</p>
