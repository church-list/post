<p>You’re able to use this in your kitchen, but it really shines out on the campsite. Portable espresso makers that work well for camping are slightly more expensive; The kona coffee press is an impressive one. They typically range from $14 to $60. A french press is one way of making coffee that involves steeping coffee grounds into water and then literally pressing them out. Hence a need for an update on coffee outdoors.</p>
