<p><strong>Laird Coffee Creamer Ingredients</strong>. If you are using fresh ingredients for this recipe and add them to hot coffee, it should mix in just fine without any clumping (from my experience). Therefore, these flavors might not be the best to use on the go. I blend a couple of tablespoons with a quart of almond milk in a blender and use it as my go to creamer for my coffee. The taste is on point too!</p>
