Let me show you how to make the best iced coffee recipe fast at home without a blender. The traditional vietnamese iced coffee (ca phe sua da) is made using a filter to make decotion and that is used to steep into condensed milk with no milk added, then served with lots of ice.i made a instant version,reduced condensed milk, replace it with milk still it tasted soo good.kids loved it so much! Simply dissolve the instant coffee in water (this doesn’t take long). Iced coffee seriously can�t be beaten when the good weather rolls around. Obviously, if you�re a bit of a coffee snob you might want to stick to the proper brewed stuff, but if you�re after a simple quick and easy drink then your standard granules will work.</p>
