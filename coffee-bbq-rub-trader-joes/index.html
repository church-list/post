<p>In a bowl, combine honey, dijon mustard and oil. 2 tablespoons instant coffee 3 tablespoons granulated sweetener of choice (coconut sugar, demerara sugar, brown sugar, white sugar, maple sugar, etc.) 1 tablespoon smoked paprika 2 teaspoons regular paprika 2 teaspoons garlic powder or granulated garlic 2/take the cooked ribs out of water and season them with trader joe’s coffee and garlic bbq rub &amp; seasoning and some additional salt. Preheat the oven to 325°f and allow steak to come to room temperature. 3/cover the seasoned ribs with aluminum foil and bake them at 400ºf for 20 minutes. It reminds me of coffee, but it doesn’t taste like coffee.</p>
