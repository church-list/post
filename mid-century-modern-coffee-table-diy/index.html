<p>Lots of details to share but i wanted to finally post the tutorial for my diy mid century modern coffee table that i built last year! This meant that i needed legs that were approximately 2¾” tall. I think makeover tutorials such as this one are so inspiring, because they help me see potential in so many second hand/charity store pieces! This piece is a timeless classic with all the functionality we have come to expect from danish modern design. At the same time, its double shelf is making it highly functional for keeping your things organized. This baby is easy to make, inexpensive and the perfect addition to your home… i really wasn’t messing around when i told you i was currently obsessed with all things mid century.</p>
