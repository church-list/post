<p><strong>French Press Coffee Amount</strong>. Depending on the amount of coffee that you would like to brew, this amount can end up varying. To achieve a full expression of the coffee, decant it immediately after brewing so it doesn’t become bitter or chalky. Pour hot water—not quite boiling—into the pot, and gently stir. As the french press brews unfiltered coffee, the amount of cafestol in french press coffee is significantly higher compared to that of filtered coffee as the filter paper retains most of the quantity, letting only a small or negligible amount to pass via filter.</p>

<p>The ratio of water to ground coffee is quite simple. Get the french press ready. While there�s a maximum amount that your french press will make, there isn�t really a minimum. Some call for 2 tablespoons per 6 oz of water, others per 4 oz. All you need to do is add coarsely ground coffee and hot water and then wait until it is ready. Others said to use one or the other, and add water after brewing if it�s too strong.</p>

Most people throw in the coffee grounds, tip in some water, press the plunger, and then pour straightaway. As the french press brews unfiltered coffee, the amount of cafestol in french press coffee is significantly higher compared to that of filtered coffee as the filter paper retains most of the quantity, letting only a small or negligible amount to pass via filter.
