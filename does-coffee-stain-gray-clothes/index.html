<p><strong>Does Coffee Stain Gray Clothes</strong>. Gloria i use coffee as a gentle hair dye on my grey hair. Gently run cold water through the back of the coffee stain till it all washes off. Whatever piece of wood you want to stain; As with all stained cotton fabric, the stained area should not be dried until the stain is fully removed.</p>

<p>The stronger the coffee, the darker the stain. Now get plain cold water and a new white cloth and sponge the area to remove the rubbing alcohol, and then blot dry. For this kind of stain, you just need to use a stronger cleaning solution. Let it dry for a few minutes. Vinegar is beneficial for washable fabrics, such as polyester, and is safer than chemical stain removal products or stain removers that contain harsh solvents. Not only does it look spectacular, but a few layers of protective gel stains can efficiently keep the thing from getting damaged by spillage and weathering.</p>

<p>Then, let the coffee cool completely so it�s not hot when you�re using it. Make sure you wet as little of the fabric as possible. Treat the stain with water. The stronger the coffee, the darker the stain. If stain remains, or blood stain is older, soak in a solution of 2 tablespoons of ammonia per 1 gallon of cold water. (i am not talking about 3 in 1 coffee… but coffee with separate creamer, may it be powder or liquid) not a problem.</p>
