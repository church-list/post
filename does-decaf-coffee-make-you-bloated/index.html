<p><strong>Does Decaf Coffee Make You Bloated</strong>. As coffee is acidic, and stimulates stomach acid, it can act as an irritant, particularly if you suffer from conditions such as ibs, and thus can provoke swelling, bloating and sudden diarrhoea if you have a delicate digestive system. To always play it safe, aiassa advises to stay away from drinks that are saturated with salt, such as soda. That is why coffee “wakes up” some people and puts others “to sleep”. Roger gebhard, m.d., gastroenterologist, states that coffee of any kind can overexcite the digestive tract and may stimulate spasms in the bowel that cause bloating. luckily, bloating is temporary.</p>
