<p><strong>Mcdonalds Hot Coffee Lawsuit</strong>. This case received a great deal of publicity and became a prime example for frivolous lawsuits which garnered large monetary damages. Liebeck sought the help of a personal injury attorney in a law office in santa fe, new mexico. Mcdonald’s had faced claims from more than 700 people prior to 1992, who all claimed they were burned by coffee that was served too hot. Now, to be clear, liebeck never blamed mcdonald�s for her accident, but rather, took issue with the coffee�s temperature being insanely hot.</p>
