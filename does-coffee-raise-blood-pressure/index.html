<p><strong>Does Coffee Raise Blood Pressure</strong>. Caffeine from two or three cups of coffee can raise the top number in your blood pressure by 3 to 14 mm hg and the bottom number 4 to 13 mm hg. But there is still no scientific evidence that drinking caffeine in long term would increase the risk of hypertension. However, if you drink it regularly, this effect is diminished. If caffeine doesn’t raise your blood pressure, does to cause heart disease too?</p>
