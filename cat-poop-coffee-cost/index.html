<p><strong>Cat Poop Coffee Cost</strong>. In the uk, a single cup can cost £60, while in the us it’ll set you back $80 per cup. The poop is then dried, removed, and then processed to make kopi luwak. It’s the world’s most expensive coffee, and it’s made from poop. That’s a lot of money just for a small amount of shitty coffee.</p>

<p>I love the after taste of the cat poop. But cat poop coffee — that is, civet coffee (or kopi luwak, as pronounced in indonesian) — is real, and really expensive. Or rather, it’s made from coffee beans that are partially digested and then pooped out by the civet, a catlike creature. Kopi luwak is the most expensive coffee in the world with the price tag of $700 per kilogram. Like $60 for 4 ounces of beans — or in some boutique cafes, at. Basically, the coffee beans are fed to civets, who later digest it and pass it as poop.</p>

<p>Nutty fecal flavor is like nothing else. Metrowebukmetro thursday 10 apr 2008 12:01 am. But cat poop coffee — that is, civet coffee (or kopi luwak, as pronounced in indonesian) — is real, and really expensive. Because of its rarity thus limiting its suply, bat poop coffee cost a little bit much compared normal coffee. That’s a lot of money just for a small amount of shitty coffee. I started just eating the beans without brewing the coffee.</p>

<p>Kopi luwak is a coffee that consists of partially digested coffee cherries, which were eaten and defecated by the asian palm civet (paradoxurus hermaphroditus).it is therefore also called civet coffee.the cherries are fermented as they pass through a civet�s intestines, and after being defecated with other fecal matter, they are collected.</p>
