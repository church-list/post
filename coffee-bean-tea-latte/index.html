<p>The puccini coffee beans are precisely what you need to blend an exceptional cup of piping hot, milky latte. At the coffee bean &amp; tea leaf®, our standard and number one priority is quality. Our chai extract mix combined with french deluxe™ vanilla powder and topped with thick foam offers the perfect deliciously mellow blend of rich, black tea infused with sweet spice flavors of cinnamon. Coffee bean’s promotional materials say that “the rachel” is a matcha latte not because her last name is the color of this tea, even though that would’ve been totally good enough for me! Darjeeling tea infused with the rich warm spices of cloves, nutmeg, vanilla, cinnamon and ginger. It’s deliciously rich with a dark chocolate flavor and a hint of holiday cheer.</p>
