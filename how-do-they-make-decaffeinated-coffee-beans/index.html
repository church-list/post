<p>Next, the beans are transferred to another container and immersed in coffee oils that were obtained from spent coffee grounds and left to soak. How do they make decaffeinated coffee? Decaf coffee was originally made by using organic solvents to dissolve the caffeine and carry it away without also removing the sugars, peptides and other components of coffee that give it its flavor. There is an exact science behind the magical elixir we drink every day, the perfect concoction of chemicals that exhibit the aroma and flavors we all enjoy. It is carried out while the beans are still ‘green’, before they are roasted. Under european law decaffeinated coffee must contain 0.1%, or less, caffeine in roasted coffee beans, and up to 0.3%, or less, in soluble/instant coffee.</p>
<h3 id="green-robusta-coffee-beans-contain-around-22-caffeine-by-mass-whereas-the-figure-for-green-arabica-coffee-beans-stands-at-12">Green robusta coffee beans contain around 2.2% caffeine by mass, whereas the figure for green arabica coffee beans stands at 1.2%.</h3>
<p>No, green coffee beans are not from outer space or the creations of a mad scientist. Since 70% of all coffee is decaffeinated with the help of solvents, i’ll start with solvent based processes. The beans are then dried and shipped to their destination, and the green coffee extract is decaffeinated for further use. The beans are decaffeinated before they’re roasted and ground. Similar to the water processing, the green coffee beans are first soaked in water. The water is then returned to the beans for reabsorption of flavors and oils.</p>
