<p><strong>How To Make Perfect French Press Coffee Reddit</strong>. I used the method of james hoffmann and everything worked out perfectly the first time i tried it. Give the french press a quick swirl, and then wait 30 seconds. Stir on top and scoop out excess. The french press was invented back in the 20th century (and i’m sure it won’t surprise you) in france thus it gains its name after its native country.</p>

<p>This is called the coffee bloom, and indicates fresh beans. It’s essentially the same kind of brew method as a french press but better filtered. (30 grams of coffee for a 16 oz (500g) french press.). Add a pinch of kosher salt. It’s the best way to make several cups of coffee quickly, perfect for five or six people. Add coffee grounds and then zero out or tare your scale.</p>

<p>Espresso is a favorite coffee drink of many. Put the kettle back on the stove, and keep the temperature high. Set your timer for four minutes and pour in just enough water to saturate the grounds. French press coffee calls for a coarse, even grind. I just love the french press for its simplicity. However, you need to get a few things right before you can claim that you have mastered this method.</p>
