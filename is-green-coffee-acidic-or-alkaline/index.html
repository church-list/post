<p>While it�s not as acidic as coffee itself, it does increase the overall acidity. In fact, i studied the effects of caffeine on the body, and it really put my off drinking coffee for quite some time. One analysis found that coffee was less acidic than lemon tea and more acidic than black. Black tea was found to have a ph of 6.37, while coffee had a ph of 5.35. A lower ph level is more acidic, and higher ph levels are considered more alkaline. Acids are sour and corrosive.</p>
