<p><strong>Simple Syrup For Coffee Cake</strong>. Drizzle it over pound cake or a bundt cake. This will make a thin simple syrup for glazing on cakes. This sweet mixture can be used to sweeten coffee drinks or cocktails. Simple syrup is a mixture of sugar and water that is heated briefly so the sugar dissolves.</p>

<p>I use it on cakes, cupcakes, cookies (on the rare occasion) and even in my cocktails! It is also great for serving on pancakes, as an icecream topping, drizzling over a simple pound cake and using in coffee dessert recipes. Simple syrup is a standard component in a baker or cook�s arsenal. Coffee flavoured syrup is perfect for making coffee milkshakes, iced coffee and coffee cocktails. I add vanilla to this recipe to make syrup for iced coffee. The recipe for simple syrup is easy and can be modified in a million ways.</p>

<p>After i pour the simple syrup over the cake (and it soaks in) i will wrap it in plastic wrap then store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Simple syrup soaks into any type of cake sponge, leaving it deliciously soft and moist for long periods of time. You can also drizzle a dry cake with simple syrup to moisten or flavor it, and use a large batch of simple syrup to make a simple sorbet or granita with fresh fruit. A basic coffee syrup is just a simple syrup, but you can also add a variety of your favorite herbs, spices, and extras to make special flavored syrups. Coffee flavoured syrup is perfect for making coffee milkshakes, iced coffee and coffee cocktails. To make the coffee syrup, combine the coffee, sugar and 170 ml (5½ fl oz/⅔ cup) water in a small saucepan and stir over medium heat until the sugar has dissolved.</p>
