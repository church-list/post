<p><strong>Nutpods Coffee Creamer Recipe</strong>. We know thereâ€™s a recipe out there where eggs, coconut milk, dates, and some voodoo magic are combined with prayers to create a thick, creamy concoction that can take the place of your cream and sugar (or coffeemate) and once again transform your undrinkable black coffee into sweet, dreamy. If you are a coffee drinker, then your morning brew is probably the most necessary part of your breakfast routine. I like this recipe because it uses coconut milk which contain medium chain fatty acids that readily convert to ketones. This low carb coffee creamer recipe has just 0.6g net carbs per serving (2 tablespoons).</p>
