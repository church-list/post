<p><strong>Pumpkin Spice Latte Cold Brew Coffee Starbucks</strong>. Cold coffee lovers rejoice, as starbucks introduces pumpkin spice cream cold brew! The difference in price between the two drinks was minimal — at my location in los angeles, a grande pumpkin cream cold brew was $4.45, and a grande iced pumpkin spice latte was $4.95. The cold brew is made with cold brew coffee and mixed with a few pumps of vanilla, then topped with a pumpkin cream cold foam and a few shakes of starbucks’ signature pumpkin spice topping. Our cold brew sweetened with vanilla syrup, topped with a pumpkin spice cold foam topping.</p>
