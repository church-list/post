<p><strong>Making Coffee In A Percolator Pot</strong>. Allow the percolator time to cool down, then dump out the spent grounds, as well as any unwanted coffee dregs still in the bottom of the pot.

Put the coffee stem in place.</p>

<p>Because of the size of the percolator (several models are quite large), it is easy to underestimate the quantity of coffee required for a good brew. Some trial and error, a little experimentation, and you will have possibly the best pot of coffee you have ever made. If you’re brewing a full pot, stop filling the percolator just below the upper portion where the basket goes. Put your percolator on your heat source. The moka pot was an italian invention, intended for making espresso at home in a time when espresso machines were gigantic and only for commercial use: You should use one heaped spoon of coffee for each cup of water in the pot.</p>
