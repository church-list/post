<p>Come meet the crew and taste some insane coffees! Posted on saturday, 7 september 2019 ad by snoffeecob. Service and atmosphere was also okay. Padahal beberapa jam lagi saya harus menghadiri warehouse party yang diadakan perusahaan coffee tumbler terkenal yaitu keep cup.berhubung masih ada jeda waktu sedikit saya memberanikan diri untuk ‘kabur’ sebentar ke proud mary melbourne. A stalwart of melbourne coffee culture, collingwood’s proud mary make a mean brew with coffee that’s roasted in their factory just down the road. It also does one of my favourite coffees in melbourne, so i was keen to visit the place again when a friend wanted to catch up around the fitzroy area.</p>
