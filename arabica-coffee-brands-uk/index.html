<p>With the promise of using 100% of arabica beans, this ground coffee is no different than the rest in sourcing from the top 10% of beans in the world. Coffee purists do favour arabica. Only two types of coffee beans arabica and robusta. The coffee that most are accustomed to is made from arabica beans which typically have better flavor but a lower caffeine concentration. So, many brands of lower cost coffee tend to favour a blend of robusta (for the price) and arabica (for the taste). Quality and price are rated much higher.</p>
