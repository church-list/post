<p>I was almost settled on swiss coffee but i thought the white dove was just a bit more white/bright. More than 97 locations, color wheel paint. Finding warm paint can be tricky so i reviewed a few. After trying samples of swiss coffee, white dove, simply white, and linen white in multiple different areas on the house and viewing them at different times of the day i went with benjamin moore white dove. Valspar ® color matched paint. Swiss coffee and just like with any paint color, getting samples before buying is very important.</p>
