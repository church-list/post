<p><strong>Whipped Iced Coffee Ingredients</strong>. I used two tablespoons each of coffee/sugar/water, and it whipped up a generous amount of fluffy coffee. Instead of white sugar, i used coconut sugar. Instant coffee, sugar, water, and milk. To make the simple syrup, combine sugar and 1 cup water in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved.</p>

<p>Iced coffee frappe simple bites. I never use instant coffee, so that was the only ingredient i had to purchase. Whip instant coffee, sugar, and water until foamy and serve over cold milk for a refreshing homemade iced latte. The only slightly uncommon ingredient is instant coffee. Your favorite milk to serve it with (as much or as little as you like) ice (if you want it iced) an electric hand mixer or whisk. Combine instant coffee, sugar, and hot water, and vanilla in a small bowl.</p>
