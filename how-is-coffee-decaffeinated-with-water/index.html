<p><strong>How Is Coffee Decaffeinated With Water</strong>. To begin the decaffeination process, green coffee beans are soaked in hot water to dissolve the caffeine. Legend has it that his quest for decaffeinated coffee was motivated by the belief that excessive coffee drinking had poisoned his father. With the swiss water decaffeination process, hot water is used to extract the caffeine molecules, along with the flavours molecules.
