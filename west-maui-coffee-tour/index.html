<p>Our guests absolutely loved the tour and we were so glad to have shared maui’s agricultural beauty on maui country farm tours. You can make it a very mellow, sightseeing tour, focus on history and culture, take in the views, visit iao valley, and do some light walking and maybe a little shopping. Voted maui’s favorite turtle sighting eco adventure for 6 years running, prepare to be blown away by the underwater experience that is turtle town. Make sure you look down to the west going up and back!! It�s now roasted and sold under the mill house restaurant name. Our tour starts off with a light continental breakfast with outstanding views of the west maui mountains.</p>

<p>I�m not sure if there is actually a coffee tour but i believe they do a plantation tour where you see and learn about quite a few crops growing.

Join us for a guided tour and learn how chocolate is made from branch to bar.
