<p>I use a metal cream/milk pourer, but you can use a coffee mug. It is easier to weaken coffee that is too. Despite its name, crema has nothing to do with cream—it�s actually foam made from sugar that�s been thoroughly beaten with a splash of coffee. For starters, you have to understand that cuban coffee is a mixture of finely ground espresso and sugar! Fill the reservoir with water. Brew coffee in a stove pot, use instant coffee, improvise a coffee filter, or make a cold brew concentrate that’ll keep you caffeinated for a few days, until you get your hands on a new coffee machine.</p>

<p>Fill a moka pot with coffee and water. Traditionally, cubans make cafecito using a stovetop moka pot, which creates a dark, rich brew similar to espresso. Try 2 tablespoons per mug at first. Leave the lid open so you can see inside. Put your moka pot on the stove and heat. Cuban coffee is served at the end of a meal in tacitas (tiny cups) that are smaller than demitasse cups.</p>
