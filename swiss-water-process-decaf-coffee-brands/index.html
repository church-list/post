<p><strong>Swiss Water Process Decaf Coffee Brands</strong>. Developed a commercially viable decaffeination process using water only — no solvents whatsoever. The fda currently allows methylene chloride to be used in some coffee decaffeination processes and brands are not required to disclose the decaffeination process on their label. As in the indirect solvent or solvent/water process described earlier, the various chemical constituents of the green coffee, including the caffeine, are first removed by soaking the beans in very hot water. Some recent research from mount sinai medical center showed how decaf coffee has health benefits.</p>

<p>How do you choose the best decaf coffee? There are no chemicals used in this practice. As in the indirect solvent or solvent/water process described earlier, the various chemical constituents of the green coffee, including the caffeine, are first removed by soaking the beans in very hot water. This decaf coffee has a rich and strong taste. A chemical free way to decaffeinate coffee is the swiss water process, which has been around since the 1930s and uses osmosis to get rid of caffeine. In a nutshell, the swiss water process relies on caffeine solubility (dissolvability) and osmosis to remove caffeine from green coffee beans.</p>
<h3 id="whole-coffee-beans-are-soaked-in-hot-water-which-helps-the-process-of-dissolving-the-caffeine-get-started">Whole coffee beans are soaked in hot water, which helps the process of dissolving the caffeine get started.</h3>
<p>Developed a commercially viable decaffeination process using water only — no solvents whatsoever. Then we add local water and a dash of loving attention by monitoring time and temperature until the coffee is 99.9% caffeine free. This colombian decaf is popular for its tasting notes of sweet, rich, mild and smooth flavors. The swiss water process and mountain water process each claim to remove 99.9% of caffeine from their batches. So, you want to drink decaf coffee but don’t want harsh chemical residues in it. We believe this is the best process for decaffeination.</p>
