<p><strong>Making A Coffee Table Out Of An Old Door</strong>. I’ve made a small table out of a cabinet door way back in the day, but it’s much easier and prettier when you have the right tools. If your door has an astragal (shown), a trim piece to hide the gap between a pair of cabinet doors, pry it off to level the surface. Position the legs in different areas of the tire bottom to see which placement has the best balance. If you have an old door which you are thinking to change in your home, do not throw it away, it can be really useful to create another furniture object in your house.</p>
