<p><strong>Platner Coffee Table Base</strong>. Both elegant and whimsical, the stainless steel wire base was designed to resemble a shiny sheaf of wheat. But it could have a more rational base instead of being applied decoration…i thought why separate support from the object. Inspired by the original 1966 platner collection designed by warren platner, this dining table captures the iconic modernist era style. Various surface materials are available in tempered glass, marble or wood to accentuate the custom design of the polished nickel or metallic bronze base and complement the overall elegance of your space.</p>
