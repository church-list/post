<p>I made a lot of lattes and mochas. Buy specialty coffee, geisha and coffee equipment. Nothing to write home about. The senior flamemaster release was also a personal favourite. I had one coworker tell me my mocha made the mccafe he had that morning taste like trash. Proud mary is more than just a coffee shop.</p>

<p>Service and atmosphere was also okay. Proud mary is more than just a coffee shop. There is a light menu available, but every thing is fresh and delicious, all at reasonable prices. Proud mary coffee is the best (a bit expensive) but you are paying for quality at every level of the coffee bean.
