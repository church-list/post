<p>Virtually all types of decaf coffee contain caffeine. On average, a 250ml (8.5fl oz) cup of decaf coffee contains 6mg of caffeine whereas the same serving of regular caffeinated coffee contains 100mg of caffeine. While.1% caffeine most likely isn�t enough to keep you up at night that still doesn�t answer our question. Caffeine is shown in milligrams (mg). By saying coffee is decaf, the manufacturer is just trying to inform you that your coffee underwent the process of removing 97% or more of the caffeine from it, not that it is at 0mg. An 8 oz cup of brewed coffee contains anywhere between 95 and 165 mg of caffeine, explains mayo clinic.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-did-not-know-it-decaf-coffee-still-has-some-caffeine-in-it">If you did not know it, decaf coffee still has some caffeine in it.</h3>
<p>Decaf doesn’t remove all of the caffeine, but it does remove the potassium. Decaf coffee isn’t caffeine free. Several factors affect the actual amount including the variety and brew time. But then you find that you’re still feeling symptoms after drinking it. An eight ounce cup of regular coffee might have anywhere from 70 to 200 mg of caffeine, depending on the brand and type of coffee beans used. Decaffeinated coffee, known as decaf for short, is ordinary coffee that has had most of its caffeine removed from it before the beans are roasted.</p>
