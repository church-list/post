<p><strong>Iced Instant Coffee Foam</strong>. If you love to drink iced coffee, this will change your life! The drip coffee version will start to separate and you will see the coffee liquid accumulating on the bottom after a day or so but the flavor will still be good. 2% dairy milk creates the most foam, plain soy milk has a rich, creamy taste, while almond milk has a mild sweet taste but not as creamy compared to soy. Take cold milk and put it in a french press and move the plunger up and down 40 times.</p>
