<p>I topped the new stain job with some wipe on poly. I loved the way your table turned out, however mine doesn’t have the beautiful wood grain pattern that yours does. How would you guys like to see a furniture makeover today? This table was owned by our former neighbor, a hellcat pilot in wwii. I found this antique drop leaf table on the side of the road and as soon as i saw the square nails from the 1800�s i knew the value and potential and was definitely willing to put in the work to make it beautiful again. I can’t read the label on the drop leaf table, but i believe it is the design of a stickley rosewood drop leaf table.</p>
