<p>It�s one of the few brewing methods that allows all the natural oils and proteins in the grounds to be present in the final cup. The beloved beverage can be made with items ranging from a french press to a mason jar, and its two main brewing methods involve steeping coffee grounds in cold water anywhere from 12 to 24 hours or using a drip style. “cold press coffee is not the same as cold coffee offered at large coffee chains, with their creams and syrups and whipped cream. It has a compact size that takes up less space in refrigerators, and the draining starts automatically when the brewer is placed on the carafe.

It�s one of the few brewing methods that allows all the natural oils and proteins in the grounds to be present in the final cup. The contraption features a perforated “rainwater” overhead that sprinkles water over the coffee grounds for even extraction. Think of a plunger method but using cold water and taking much, much longer (these are the main similarities!).</p>
