<p>Most of us just wake up in the morning and make a cup of coffee when we’re half asleep. By comparison, a regular cup of coffee contains 85 mg of caffeine. That said caffeine does not make a coffee bolder or stronger! When searching for the perfect coffee bean for a nice, strong cup, death wish will suit your best. Espresso (undiluted) or the aeropress. The decaf process removes oils and flavors as well as the caffeine, leaving a blah cup behind.</p>

Many larger coffee brewers at coffee shops are actually doing this already in a process called bypass, running some water around the side of the basket of grinds. A good cup of decaffeinated coffee is hard to find, as any decaf fan knows. If the coffee has the right flavor balance but is too strong, you can dilute it by adding water after the fact. To make your coffee taste stronger add more grounds.</p>
