<p><strong>Mixing Protein Powder With Iced Coffee</strong>. Chill in fridge until cool. I decided to try making a mocha with 6oz. If you want to add an entire scoop of whey protein in your coffee, mix in 1/2 scoop first until the powder is dissolved, then mix in the 2nd half. Use your fork to mix thoroughly, getting rid of any clumps.</p>

<p>Optimum nutrition gold standard 100% whey protein powder, coffee: Chike nutrition high protein coffee: The rumor mill starting churning when researchers at cornell university found that proteins (and their own unique chain of amino acids) become unfolded or ‘denatured’ from their natural chain or shape. I decided to try making a mocha with 6oz. If you add the protein powder when the coffee is warm, it will clump up, and there will be no saving it. Use your fork to mix thoroughly, getting rid of any clumps.</p>

<p>Optimum nutrition gold standard 100% whey protein powder, coffee: Or add creamer/milk to the coffee first to cool it slightly, then sprinkle/stir or blend in whey protein as above. And if you add the collagen when the drink is cold, it�s really, really hard to dissolve. Use a blender to combine your coffee and your whey powder and ice, pulsing until the ice is crushed for iced coffee or blended for a shake. So, i started reading that adding protein can negate the effectiveness of the protein powder. Cold coffee with whey protein can be reheated in the microwave.</p>
