<p><strong>Keto Friendly Coffee Creamer Powder</strong>. I’ve already made a liquid coffee creamer (with a bunch of flavors to choose from if you so desire), a pumpkin coffee creamer (made using real pumpkin!), and a christmas edition coffee creamer. Almond milk and creamers : You can’t even use a combination of powdered milk and powdered cream. I used coconut milk for this recipe to keep it dairy free, but please look further down the page to find options that do include dairy.</p>
