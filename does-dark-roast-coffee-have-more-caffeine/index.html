The degree to which coffee beans are roasted affects the caffeine level. The most common question people wonder is, “does dark roast have more caffeine in a keurig?” the short answer is, “no.

<p>If you measure your coffee by weight using a scale: Measuring by weight (mass) will give you about the same caffeine every time, regardless of roast level. Well, we are here to solve the mystery and provide you with a detailed, yet simple, explanation of which has more caffeine. This is because the longer the beans are roasted, the more caffeine burns off. The effect of roasting on caffeine is so minimal it can really only be observed in a controlled laboratory setting. Contrary to what you might expect by looking at it, dark roast coffee actually has far less caffeine in it than a light roast coffee.</p>
<h3 id="while-a-light-roast-bean-and-dark-roast-bean-may-have-the-same-amount-of-caffeine-when-you-look-at-the-finished-brew-there-may-be-negligible-smidgen-more-caffeine-in-a-dark-roast-simply-because-theres-less-of-other-stuff-in-there">While a light roast bean and dark roast bean may have the same amount of caffeine, when you look at the finished brew, there may be negligible smidgen more caffeine in a dark roast simply because there’s less of other stuff in there.</h3>
<p>That’s why you have more beans by mass of dark roasts. Since caffeine level is unaffected by the amount of roasting, more beans = more caffeine. Some people think that lighter roasted coffee beans have more caffeine because they are roasted at lower temperatures, and for that reason, the caffeine will not degrade. So which coffee roast has more caffeine ? Both of those schools of thought are wrong because all roasts of the same bean have basically the same amount of caffeine. If you measure coffee beans by scoops, light roasts have more caffeine because they’re denser than the beans that have gone through a longer and darker roast;</p>
