<h3 id="put-the-lid-on-and-give-it-a-good-shake-for-10-seconds">Put the lid on and give it a good shake for 10 seconds.</h3>
<p>Put the lid on and give it a good shake for 10 seconds. Whether you like plain iced coffee, vanilla iced. Pour freshly brewed coffee into a large container (with a lid) of ice (work quickly so that the ice doesn’t all melt into your coffee). A perfect balance of coffee, vanilla, milk, and caramel makes a sweet and creamy summer drink. In a blender, mix together almond milk with agave, vanilla bean and cinnamon until combined. Be sure to freeze the glasses as it�s the secret to avoiding melted ice cream.</p>
