<p><strong>Coconut Coffee Scrub And Wash</strong>. I love my coffee and coconut oil sugar scrub, though i use fresh unused coffee ground really fine espresso style and make a big batch, which lasts in an air tight container until i run out. Add 1/2 cup coconut oil into the coffee mixture and 1 tsp. Infused with exotic arabica coffee &amp; coconut oil, this exfoliating &amp; moisturizing blend will help soften &amp; hydrate your skin. I also love the yoghurt and coffee face scrub that jessica alba suggests.</p>
